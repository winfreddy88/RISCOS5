things to do (varying in priority)
----------------------------------
* make adding of -t option trough configfile (and remove --enable-debug)
  (also make it possible to add other options (e.g. -R)
* cvsd: implement a connectionsperminute
* debian: ask per repository whether to initialize
* cvsd: throttle bandwidth (see trickle)??
* debian: add a warning if cvs pserver is configured through cvs (db_get cvs/pserver)
* debian: add checks for correct parameters (cvsd/listen)
* cvsd: add assertions to code for all/most function parameters
* cvsd-buildroot: add debug option to display output of ldd, chown, tar, etc
* cvsd: maybe do fork() earlier so that connection cannot be stopped with slow name lookups etc
* cvsd-buildroot: add quiet (-q) option
* debian cronjob: warn if files in / are newer than files in /var/lib/cvsd
* get cvsd working under cygwin
* cvsd-buildroot: if any directories in chroot jail (besides the ones created) are not mentioned as repos in cvsd.conf give a warning
* cvsd-buginfo: check persmissions of files (read access to repository)
* cvsd-buginfo (maybe cvsd-buildroot): check CVSROOT/config for SystemAuth=no and PamAuth=no
* cvsd-buildroot: complain about libraries that shouldn't be there
