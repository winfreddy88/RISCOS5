changes from 0.8b1 to 0.8b2
---------------------------

* added user `cvsadmin' wit password `cvsadmin' to ``system'' passwd
  file (/etc/passwd in the cvsd-root). this user is allowed to
  read write all repositories (if not denied by a cvs mechanism like
  the readers file)
* bad permissions on some dirs. all dirs (and files) now belong to cvsadmin.
  hmm.. what do you think?
* a major bug fix: memory allocation problem (which somehow only
  is a problem if you have a lot of CVSROOTs). fixed.
* some bugs in the Makefile, bad permissions, bad shell for su command,
  and some others.


changes from 0.7 to 0.8b1
-------------------------

* cvsd.c: not much of the original sources (0.6) remained. almost everything
  is rewritten and overthought.
* cvsd now aborts if there isn't any valid CVSROOT in the config file.
* simplified config file and introduced command line options
  Why should one specify the uid, gid and cvsd-root in the config file?
  Such things don`t change frequently and perhaps the sysop wants to
  allow other people adding/removing repositories. So:
  --uid or -u        specifies the uid cvs will run as. has default.
  --gid or -g        specifies the gid cvs will run as. has default.
  --root or -r       specifies the cvsd-root (where to chroot). NO default.
  --config -f        specifies the config file (i.e. list of allowed
                     repositories). has default.
  --verbose          turns on verbose logging (to syslog). if set cvsd
                     reports about everything. also the flag -t is passed
                     to cvs which means 'trace' and enables more verbose
                     working of cvs pserver.
  --help             prints help screen (to stdout!)
  --version          prints version information (to stdout!)
* logging: cvsd almost only reports via the syslog LOG_DAEMON facility. it
  uses  priority LOG_INFO for informational things and LOG_ERR for errors.
  if !verbose and no errors occurred (i.e. suspicious directory mode) cvsd
  only reports `connection mad.' to syslog and then passes over to cvs.
* permission checks: cvsd now checks for proper mode on several
  files/directories. in general uid/gid needs to be those of the cvsd user
  and there may not be any bits set for the other user. furthermore the w bit
  for the group mustn't be set and no file (or dir) may be a symlink. see the
  #defines in cvsd.c for details.
  - the cvsd-root
  - the /etc/passwd file (relative to cvsd-root, of course)
  - the /bin/cvs file
  - every directory listed in /etc/cvsd.conf. bad dirs will be ignored.
* 0.7 was c++, 0.8 is c again.
* hey gurus, what do you think? is this worth something?
  don't hesitate: phkehl@gmx.net
* Makefile / Installation
  - nicer `make user' and `make group'
  - there's an (empty) example CVSROOT (mad by `make install')
* the name is /example and there are two users:
* user example with password example who may read and write (import and such)
* user cvsread with password cvsread who has read-only access (this is
* done via the normal cvs pserver mechanism, i.e. cvsread is listed in
  /example/CVSROOT/readers


changes from 0.6 to 0.7
-----------------------

* cleaner config file and cleaner
