.nh
.SH "NAME"
cvsd.conf \- configuration file for cvsd.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file
.I cvsd.conf
contains the configuration information for running \(oqcvsd\(cq (see
.BR cvsd (8)
).
The file contains options, one on each line, specifying the
workings of cvsd.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fBRootJail\fR \fIpath\fR
This specifies the location of the chroot jail cvs should be run in.
This directory should be initialized with the cvsd\-buildroot script so it contains all the proper directories and binaries.
If this option is not present in the configuration file or a value of \(oqnone\(cq (without quotes) is specified cvsd will run in the normal filesystem root.

.TP
\fBUid\fR \fIuid\fR
This specifies which user id cvs should be run as.
This can be a numerical id or a symbolic value.
If no uid is specified cvsd will run under the uid it is started with.

.TP
\fBGid\fR \fIgid\fR
This specifies which group id cvs should be run as.
This can be a numerical id or a symbolic value.
If no gid is specified cvsd will run under the gid it is started with.

.TP
\fBCvsCommand\fR \fIpath\fR
This should be set to the location where the cvs command is located.
Note that if you set up a RootJail this is relative to that directory, but should still start with a \(oq/\(cq.
If you do not define this in the configfile a default of \(oq/bin/cvs\(cq will be used if a chroot jail has been configured and otherwise it will be set \(oq@CVS@\(cq.

.TP
\fBCvsArgs\fR \fIarg\fR...
Additional arguments to be passed to the cvs command, in addition to the default ones.
You can pass the \-R option to put cvs in read-only mode.
Note that not all options can be used in pserver mode and error messages are not always very friendly.

.TP
\fBNice\fR \fInum\fR
This specifies the nice value (on most systems ranging from \-20 to 20) where the smaller the number (more negative) the higher the priority.
If no value is specified the nice level of the program will not be altered.

.TP
\fBUmask\fR \fImask\fR
This specifies a umask used by the cvs pserver when creating files.
Specify as an octal value.
If no value is specified the default umask of 027 will be used.

.TP
\fBLimit\fR \fIresource\fR \fIvalue\fR
Limits use of a ceritain resource to the cvs process.
Note that resource limits will be set on the executed cvs command and not for the daemon.
Resouce may be one of:
.RS
.PD 0
.TP
.B coredumpsize
maixmum filesize of a coredump
.TP
.B cputime
maximum amount of seconds cputime consumed
.TP
.B datasize
maximum size of program's data segment
.TP
.B filesize
maximum size of files created
.TP
.B memorylocked
maximum amount of locked memory
.TP
.B openfiles
maximum number of open files (file descriptors)
.TP
.B maxproc
maximam number of processes (per user? max. children?)
.TP
.B memoryuse
maximum size of resident memory
.TP
.B stacksize
maximum stack size
.TP
.B virtmem
maximum amount of virtual memory allocated
.TP
.B pthreads
number of threads that the process may create
.PP
Note that not all systems may support all resources specified here.
If no limits are defined no extra limits will be enforced.
If the system already specified limits for processes it may not be possible to broaden the limits.
.br
A value (resource limit) that is a size can be specified with a suffix of \(oqb\(cq (bytes), \(oqk\(cq (1024 bytes) or \(oqm\(cq (1024*1024 bytes), where \(oqk\(cq is default.
.br
Plain number values can also have the \(oqk\(cq and \(oqm\(cq suffixes, but the default is just the plain number.
.br
Time values can be formatted as \(oqmm:ss\(cq or have a \(oqm\(cq or \(oqs\(cq suffix where \(oqs\(cq is default.
.PD
.RE

.TP
\fBPidFile\fR \fIfile\fR
This specifies the location the process id of the daemon is written.
If no PidFile is specified the pid will not be written.
/var/run/cvsd.pid is a good location for a pidfile.

.TP
\fBListen\fR \fIaddress\fR \fIport\fR
This options specifies which adresses and ports cvsd should listen on for connections.
The address value can be \(oq*\(cq (for binding all addresses) or a symbolic (hostname), dotted quad or ipv6 address.
The port value can be a numeric portnumber or a well known service (\(oqcvspserver\(cq).
This option can be supplied multiple times.
The address and port fields can be combined in the usual ways by seporating them with a \(oq:\(cq or a \(oq.\(cq, optionally surrounding the address part by square brackets (\(oq[\(cq and \(oq]\(cq).
.br
Some examples:
.ft B
    # listen on all interfaces and all protocols on port 2401
    Listen * 2401
    # listen on IPv6 port 100
    Listen :: 100
    # listen on localhost
    Listen localhost cvspserver
    # listen on an ipv6 address
    Listen [fe80::2a0:d2ff:fea5:e9f5]:2401
.ft R

.TP
\fBMaxConnections\fR \fInum\fR
This specifies the maximum number of connections that can be handled simultaneously.
When the value 0 (the default) is supplied no limit is used.

.TP
\fBLog\fR \fIscheme/file\fR \fIlogvelel\fR
This option specifies the way logging is done.
As first argument either none, syslog or a filename beginning with a \(oq/\(cq may be specified.
The second argument is optional and specifies the loglevel.
The loglevel may be one of: crit, error, warning, notice, info (default) or debug.
All messages with the specified loglevel and higher are logged.
This option can be supplied multiple times.
If this option is omitted syslog info is assumed.

.TP
\fBRepos\fR \fIpath\fR
This option specifies which repositories can be used.
The value is passed as a \-\-allow\-root=path parameter to cvs.
The path should be relative to the specified RootJail and should start with a \(oq/\(cq.
This option can be supplied multiple times, but should be specified at least once.

.SH "FILES"
@CONFIGFILE@ \- default location for the configuration file
.br
/var/run/cvsd.pid (or other localtion) \- the file where the process id is saved
