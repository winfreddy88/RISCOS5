# CvsCommand <path>
#  If you define this it should point to the cvs
#  command to execute. Otherwise "/bin/cvs" will
#  be used if a RootJail is configured and the
#  cvs command found at compiletime otherwise.
#  The path should be relative to the specified
#  RootJail and should start with a `/'.

# CvsArgs <arg>...

#  For example, to enable read-only access to the

#  (more negative) the higher the priority.

#  <resource> can be one of: coredumpsize, cputime, datasize, filesize,
#  memorylocked, openfiles, maxproc, memoryuse, stacksize or virtmem.
#  <value> is the maximum value for the given resource. For size values
#  a suffix of 'b', 'k' or 'm' can be specified ('k' is default). Time
#  values can be formatted as 'mm:ss' or have 'm' or 's' suffixes
#  ('s' is default).
Limit coredumpsize 0

# PidFile <file>
#  This specifies the location the process id of the
#  daemon is written.

#  can be used. The value is passed as a
#  --allow-root=<path> parameter to cvs.

#  RootJail and should start with a `/'.
#  This option can be supplied multiple times.
