Template: cvsd/rootjail
Type: string
Default: /var/lib/cvsd
_Description: Location of chroot jail:
 cvsd can run in a chroot jail. This is the preferred method of
 operation. Specify the location of the chroot jail. If you make this
 'none' no chroot jail will be created and used.
 A chroot file hierarchy will be created in the specified location.

Template: cvsd/maxconnections
Type: string
Default: 10
_Description: The maximum number of connections that can be handled:
 It is possible to specify a maximum number of connections that cvsd
 can handle simultaneously. Specifying 0 (zero) will put no limit to
 the number of connections.

Template: cvsd/nice
Type: string
Default: 1
_Description: Nice value cvsd should run at:
 cvsd can be run at reduced priority so it will not take up too
 many resources, especially if a user specifies a -z option to cvs.
 The priority can also be increased (negative value here).

Template: cvsd/umask
Type: string
Default: 027
_Description: Umask cvsd should run at:
 Specify the umask cvsd and cvs should use when creating files.
 .
 The umask should be specified as an octal value and represents
 the permissions that should be taken away when creating a file
 (e.g. using 027 will create files with mode 640 or rw-r-----).

Template: cvsd/listen
Type: string
Default: * 2401
_Description: Address and port on which cvsd will listen:
 With the first argument you can specify the address cvsd should listen on.
 The '*' address specifies that cvsd should listen on all addresses.
 You can specify a IPv4 address, IPv6 address, a hostname or '*'.
 .
 The second argument is the service name (e.g. cvspserver) or port number
 (default 2401) cvsd will listen on.
 .
 The address and port should be separated by a space and you can specify multiple
 address-port combinations by separating them with spaces.

Template: cvsd/repositories
Type: string
Default: /demo:/myrepos
_Description: Repositories to serve:
 The whole idea of cvsd is to serve repositories. Specify a colon ':'
 separated list of repositories to serve. The location of these repositories
 is relative to the specified chroot jail (${rootjail}) and should start with a '/'.
 .
 The repositories here should be initialized by hand with something like
 'cvs -d ${rootjail}/myrepos init' after which passwords can be set with
 'cvsd-passwd ${rootjail}/myrepos anonymous'. See the file
 /usr/share/doc/cvsd/README.gz for details on creating repositories.

Template: cvsd/limits
Type: multiselect
__Choices: coredumpsize, cputime, datasize, filesize, memorylocked, openfiles, maxproc, memoryuse, stacksize, virtmem
_Description: Select resources of pserver processes to limit:
 The pserver wrapper can be configured to limit the resource usage that
 a pserver process can have. These resource limits will be set on each
 pserver process and not on the wrapper.
 .
 Choose from the list the resources that you want to limit.
 You will be asked to specify limits about every resource you selected here.
 .
 Note that not all resources may be available on all systems and that
 resources may be system and kernel specific so use these with caution.
 The results of exceeding the set limits may also be system specific
 but will most likely stop the cvs process and close the connection
 (may be problematic with write access to cvs repository).

Template: cvsd/limit_coredumpsize
Type: string
Default: 0
_Description: Maximum file size of a core dump:
 Set this to 0 (zero) (should be the system default) to prevent core dumps.
 Otherwise this limits the size of core dumps to the specified value.
 .
 This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
 (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.

Template: cvsd/limit_cputime
Type: string
Default: 1:00
_Description: Maximum amount of cpu time consumed:
 This limits the number of cpu seconds the cvs process can use.
 This will prevent too much cpu time from being allocated to a single connection.
 .
 This value can be formatted as 'mm:ss' or have a 'm' or 's'
 suffix where 's' is default.

Template: cvsd/limit_datasize
Type: string
Default: 10m
_Description: Maximum size of program's data segment:
 This limits the amount of memory the cvs program can use. This
 specific item limits the size of the data segment.
 .
 This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
 (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.

Template: cvsd/limit_filesize
Type: string
Default: 1m
_Description: Maximum size of files created:
 This limits the maximum size of a file created by cvs.
 Note that the cvs pserver process needs to be able to create
 lock files and possibly write history or other files so
 don't set this to 0 (zero).
 .
 This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
 (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.

Template: cvsd/limit_memorylocked
Type: string
Default: 10m
_Description: Maximum amount of locked memory:
 This limits the amount of memory the cvs process may lock.
 cvs probably doesn't need to lock any memory at all.
 .
 This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
 (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.

Template: cvsd/limit_openfiles
Type: string
Default: 1024
_Description: Maximum number of open files:
 This limits the number of files and connections that the cvs
 process can have open at a single moment. The cvs process needs
 to access quite a few files so don't set this too low.

Template: cvsd/limit_maxproc
Type: string
Default: 20
_Description: Maximum number of processes:
 This limits the maximum number of processes that a single user may have.
 cvs may need to spawn additional processes to run scripts or do subtasks
 so don't set this too low.

Template: cvsd/limit_memoryuse
Type: string
Default: 10m
_Description: Maximum size of resident memory:
 This specifies the amount of physical memory a process may have.
 .
 This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
 (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.

Template: cvsd/limit_stacksize
Type: string
Default: 10m
_Description: Maximum stack size:
 This limits the size of the stack.
 .
 This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
 (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.

Template: cvsd/limit_virtmem
Type: string
Default: 10m
_Description: Maximum amount of virtual memory allocated:
 This limits the total amount of virtual memory a process may have allocated.
 .
 This value may be specified with a suffix of 'b' (bytes), 'k'
 (1024 bytes) or 'm' (1024*1024 bytes), where 'k' is the default.

Template: cvsd/limit_pthreads
Type: string
Default: 20
_Description: Maximum number of threads:
 This limits the number of threads that a single process may have.
 .
 This is not available under Linux so it is not in the list
 for cvsd/limits. If Hurd has it it may be useful.

Template: cvsd/remove_chroot
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Remove chroot jail containing repositories?
 The following directory is configured as a chroot jail for cvsd:
   ${rootjail}
 You may choose to remove the chroot jail but you will also lose all the
 repositories inside the chroot jail. If you have not backed up your
 repositories you want to keep do not remove it now and manually remove
 it later once your repositories are safe.
 .
 If you do choose to remove the chroot directory, all directories under
 it will be removed, even if they are on another file system.
 .
 If you choose to keep the chroot jail please note that the cvsd user and
 group will be removed so uid and gid file information may no longer be
 consistent.
