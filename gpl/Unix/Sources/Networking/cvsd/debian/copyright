This is cvsd, daemon to run `cvs pserver' in a more secure
environment.

cvsd was originally written by Chris Black <cblack@mokey.com>,
http://cblack.mokey.com/. That was until release 0.6

cvsd versions up till 0.8b3 were maintained by Philippe Kehl
<phkehl@gmx.net>, http://guv.ethz.ch/~flip/cvsd/,
http://www.oinkzwurgl.org/software/cvsd/.

after that Arthur de Jong <arthur@ch.tudelft.nl>
took up the work and did a complete rewrite,
current version may be downloaded at
http://ch.tudelft.nl/~arthur/cvsd.

Arthur de Jong is both the upstream and Debian package maintainer, so
there are no differences between the Debian package and the upstream
version.
