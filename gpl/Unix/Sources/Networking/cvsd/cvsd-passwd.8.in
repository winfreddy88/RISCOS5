.TP
.B [+]USER[:SUSER]
Add or update the user to the CVSROOT/passwd file.
If the user does not exist a password for the user is asked and the user is added for use with cvsd.
If the user already exists a password for is asked and the password field is modified.

The :SUSER part can be user to change or set mapping to a system user.
If you do not specify anything, a reasonable default is used based upon your cvsd configuration.
If you don't want to map the user to any specified system user you can specify an empty SUSER and use \(oqUSER:\(cq.
.TP
.B \-USER
Remove the user from the CVSROOT/passwd file.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Add an anoncvs user to access the given repository:
.ft B
    cvsd\-passwd /var/lib/cvsd/myrepos +anoncvs
.ft R
.br
If the user already exists, change the password.

Remove a user from the repository passwd list:
.ft B
    cvsd\-passwd /var/lib/cvsd/myrepos \-foo
.ft R

Add a user and specify that cvs should remap this user to the joe system user:
.ft B
    cvsd\-passwd /var/lib/cvsd/myrepos joecvs:joe
.ft R
.br
Note that the user joe should be known in the system passwd file and that cvsd should be run as root or user joe for this to work.
