<a name="Options-That-Control-Optimization"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</h3>
<a name="index-optimize-options"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-optimization"></a>

<p>These options control various sorts of optimizations.
</p>
<p>Without any optimization option, the compiler&rsquo;s goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you would expect from the source
code.
</p>
<p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
</p>
<p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
</p>
<p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
</p>
<p>Most optimizations are only enabled if an <samp>-O</samp> level is set on
the command line.  Otherwise they are disabled, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.
</p>
<p>Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <samp>-O</samp> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with &lsquo;<samp>-Q --help=optimizers</samp>&rsquo;
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
See <a href="Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options">Overall Options</a>, for examples.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-O</code></dt>
<dt><code>-O1</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O"></a>
<a name="index-O1"></a>
<p>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-O</samp>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.
</p>
<p><samp>-O</samp> turns on the following optimization flags:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-fauto-inc-dec 
-fcompare-elim 
-fcprop-registers 
-fdce 
-fdefer-pop 
-fdelayed-branch 
-fdse 
-fguess-branch-probability 
-fif-conversion2 
-fif-conversion 
-fipa-pure-const 
-fipa-profile 
-fipa-reference 
-fmerge-constants
-fsplit-wide-types

-ftree-fre 
-ftree-phiprop 
-ftree-sra 
-ftree-pta 
-ftree-ter 
-funit-at-a-time
</pre></div>

<p><samp>-O</samp> also turns on <samp>-fomit-frame-pointer</samp> on machines
where doing so does not interfere with debugging.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-O2</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O2"></a>
<p>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
As compared to <samp>-O</samp>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.
</p>
<p><samp>-O2</samp> turns on all optimization flags specified by <samp>-O</samp>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-fthread-jumps 
-falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
-falign-loops  -falign-labels 
-fcaller-saves 
-fcrossjumping 
-fcse-follow-jumps  -fcse-skip-blocks 
-fdelete-null-pointer-checks 
-fdevirtualize 
-fexpensive-optimizations 
-fgcse  -fgcse-lm  
-finline-small-functions 
-findirect-inlining 
-fipa-sra

-fstrict-aliasing -fstrict-overflow 
-ftree-switch-conversion -ftree-tail-merge 
-ftree-pre 
-ftree-vrp
</pre></div>

<p>Please note the warning under <samp>-fgcse</samp> about
invoking <samp>-O2</samp> on programs that use computed gotos.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-O3</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O3"></a>
<p>Optimize yet more.  <samp>-O3</samp> turns on all optimizations specified
by <samp>-O2</samp> and also turns on the <samp>-finline-functions</samp>,
<samp>-funswitch-loops</samp>, <samp>-fpredictive-commoning</samp>,
<samp>-fgcse-after-reload</samp>, <samp>-ftree-vectorize</samp> and
<samp>-fipa-cp-clone</samp> options.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-O0</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O0"></a>
<p>Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results.  This is the default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Os</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Os"></a>
<p>Optimize for size.  <samp>-Os</samp> enables all <samp>-O2</samp> optimizations that
do not typically increase code size.  It also performs further
optimizations designed to reduce code size.
</p>
<p><samp>-Os</samp> disables the following optimization flags:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-falign-functions  -falign-jumps  -falign-loops 
-falign-labels  -freorder-blocks  -freorder-blocks-and-partition 
-fprefetch-loop-arrays  -ftree-vect-loop-version
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-Ofast</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Ofast"></a>
<p>Disregard strict standards compliance.  <samp>-Ofast</samp> enables all
<samp>-O3</samp> optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard compliant programs.
It turns on <samp>-ffast-math</samp> and the Fortran-specific
<samp>-fno-protect-parens</samp> and <samp>-fstack-arrays</samp>.
</p>
<p>If you use multiple <samp>-O</samp> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Options of the form <samp>-f<var>flag</var></samp> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <samp>-ffoo</samp> would be <samp>-fno-foo</samp>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one you typically will
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing &lsquo;<samp>no-</samp>&rsquo;
or adding it.
</p>
<p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <samp>-O</samp> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fno-default-inline</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefault_002dinline-1"></a>
<p>Do not make member functions inline by default merely because they are
defined inside the class scope (C++ only).  Otherwise, when you specify
<samp><span class="nolinebreak">-O</span></samp><!-- /@w -->, member functions defined inside class scope are compiled
inline by default; i.e., you don&rsquo;t need to add &lsquo;<samp>inline</samp>&rsquo; in front of
the member function name.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-defer-pop</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefer_002dpop"></a>
<p>Always pop the arguments to each function call as soon as that function
returns.  For machines that must pop arguments after a function call,
the compiler normally lets arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pops them all at once.
</p>
<p>Disabled at levels <samp>-O</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fforward-propagate</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fforward_002dpropagate"></a>
<p>Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.
</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <samp>-O</samp>,
<samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffp-contract=<var>style</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffp_002dcontract"></a>
<p><samp>-ffp-contract=off</samp> disables floating-point expression contraction.
<samp>-ffp-contract=fast</samp> enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
<samp>-ffp-contract=on</samp> enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to <samp>-ffp-contract=off</samp>.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-ffp-contract=fast</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fomit_002dframe_002dpointer"></a>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep the frame pointer in a register for functions that
don&rsquo;t need one.  This avoids the instructions to save, set up and
restore frame pointers; it also makes an extra register available
in many functions.  <strong>It also makes debugging impossible on
some machines.</strong>
</p>
<p>On some machines, such as the VAX, this flag has no effect, because
the standard calling sequence automatically handles the frame pointer
and nothing is saved by pretending it doesn&rsquo;t exist.  The
machine-description macro <code>FRAME_POINTER_REQUIRED</code> controls
whether a target machine supports this flag.  See <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Registers.html#Registers">Register
Usage</a> in <cite>GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) Internals</cite>.
</p>
<p>Starting with GCC version 4.6, the default setting (when not optimizing for
size) for 32-bit Linux x86 and 32-bit Darwin x86 targets has been changed to
<samp>-fomit-frame-pointer</samp>.  The default can be reverted to
<samp>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</samp> by configuring GCC with the
<samp>--enable-frame-pointer</samp> configure option.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-foptimize-sibling-calls</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-foptimize_002dsibling_002dcalls"></a>
<p>Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-inline</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002dinline"></a>
<p>Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with
the <code>always_inline</code> attribute.  This is the default when not
optimizing.
</p>
<p>Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them
with the <code>noinline</code> attribute.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-small-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline_002dsmall_002dfunctions"></a>
<p>Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating
in this way.  This inlining applies to all functions, even those not declared
inline.
</p>
<p>Enabled at level <samp>-O2</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-findirect-inlining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-findirect_002dinlining"></a>
<p>Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at compile
time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the <samp>-finline-functions</samp>
or <samp>-finline-small-functions</samp> options.
</p>
<p>Enabled at level <samp>-O2</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions"></a>
<p>Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not declared inline.
The compiler heuristically decides which functions are worth integrating
in this way.
</p>
<p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.
</p>
<p>Enabled at level <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-functions-called-once</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions_002dcalled_002donce"></a>
<p>Consider all <code>static</code> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <code>inline</code>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O1</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp> and <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fearly-inlining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fearly_002dinlining"></a>
<p>Inline functions marked by <code>always_inline</code> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<samp>-fprofile-generate</samp> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-sra</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dsra"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal of
unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by reference
by parameters passed by value.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp> and <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-limit=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline_002dlimit"></a>
<p>By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  <var>n</var> is the size of functions that
can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.
</p>
<p>Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <samp>--param <var>name</var>=<var>value</var></samp>.
The <samp>-finline-limit=<var>n</var></samp> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code></dt>
<dd><p>is set to <var>n</var>/2.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code></dt>
<dd><p>is set to <var>n</var>/2.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> there may be no value to <samp>-finline-limit</samp> that results
in default behavior.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function&rsquo;s size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-_002dfno_002dkeep_002dinline_002ddllexport"></a>
<p>This is a more fine-grained version of <samp>-fkeep-inline-functions</samp>,
which applies only to functions that are declared using the <code>dllexport</code>
attribute or declspec (See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Declaring Attributes of
Functions</a>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions"></a>
<p>In C, emit <code>static</code> functions that are declared <code>inline</code>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<code>extern inline</code> extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fkeep-static-consts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dconsts"></a>
<p>Emit variables declared <code>static const</code> when optimization isn&rsquo;t turned
on, even if the variables aren&rsquo;t referenced.
</p>
<p>GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if the variable was referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <samp>-fno-keep-static-consts</samp> option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmerge-constants</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dconstants"></a>
<p>Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.
</p>
<p>This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <samp>-fno-merge-constants</samp> to inhibit this
behavior.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmerge-all-constants</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dall_002dconstants"></a>
<p>Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
</p>
<p>This option implies <samp>-fmerge-constants</samp>.  In addition to
<samp>-fmerge-constants</samp> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option will result in non-conforming
behavior.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmodulo-sched</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched"></a>
<p>Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched_002dallow_002dregmoves"></a>
<p>Perform more aggressive SMS based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges will be
deleted which will trigger the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
<samp>-fmodulo-sched</samp> enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-branch-count-reg</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002dbranch_002dcount_002dreg"></a>
<p>Do not use &ldquo;decrement and branch&rdquo; instructions on a count register,
but instead generate a sequence of instructions that decrement a
register, compare it against zero, then branch based upon the result.
This option is only meaningful on architectures that support such
instructions, which include x86, PowerPC, IA-64 and S/390.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-fbranch-count-reg</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-function-cse</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002dfunction_002dcse"></a>
<p>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function&rsquo;s address explicitly.
</p>
<p>This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-ffunction-cse</samp>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002dzero_002dinitialized_002din_002dbss"></a>
<p>If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into BSS.  This can save space in the resulting
code.
</p>
<p>This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section.  E.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-fzero-initialized-in-bss</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmudflap -fmudflapth -fmudflapir</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmudflap"></a>
<a name="index-fmudflapth"></a>
<a name="index-fmudflapir"></a>
<a name="index-bounds-checking"></a>
<a name="index-mudflap"></a>
<p>For front-ends that support it (C and C++), instrument all risky
pointer/array dereferencing operations, some standard library
string/heap functions, and some other associated constructs with
range/validity tests.  Modules so instrumented should be immune to
buffer overflows, invalid heap use, and some other classes of C/C++
programming errors.  The instrumentation relies on a separate runtime
library (<samp>libmudflap</samp>), which will be linked into a program if
<samp>-fmudflap</samp> is given at link time.  Run-time behavior of the
instrumented program is controlled by the <code>MUDFLAP_OPTIONS</code>
environment variable.  See <code>env MUDFLAP_OPTIONS=-help a.out</code>
for its options.
</p>
<p>Use <samp>-fmudflapth</samp> instead of <samp>-fmudflap</samp> to compile and to
link if your program is multi-threaded.  Use <samp>-fmudflapir</samp>, in
addition to <samp>-fmudflap</samp> or <samp>-fmudflapth</samp>, if
instrumentation should ignore pointer reads.  This produces less
instrumentation (and therefore faster execution) and still provides
some protection against outright memory corrupting writes, but allows
erroneously read data to propagate within a program.
</p>

<p>In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump instructions

<p>Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides there.  This enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.

<p>Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use <samp>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</samp> to disable this optimization

<p>Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary
copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and
higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-pure-const</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dpure_002dconst"></a>
<p>Discover which functions are pure or constant.
Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.

</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-reference</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dreference"></a>
<p>Discover which static variables do not escape cannot escape the
compilation unit.
Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-pta</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dpta"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-profile</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dprofile"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
<code>cold</code>, <code>noreturn</code>, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-cp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dcp"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp> and <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-cp-clone</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dcp_002dclone"></a>
<p>Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation will perform function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see <samp>--param ipcp-unit-growth=<var>value</var></samp>).
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-matrix-reorg</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dmatrix_002dreorg"></a>
<p>Perform matrix flattening and transposing.
Matrix flattening tries to replace an <em>m</em>-dimensional matrix
with its equivalent <em>n</em>-dimensional matrix, where <em>n &lt; m</em>.
This reduces the level of indirection needed for accessing the elements
of the matrix. The second optimization is matrix transposing, which
attempts to change the order of the matrix&rsquo;s dimensions in order to
improve cache locality.
Both optimizations need the <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> flag.
Transposing is enabled only if profiling information is available.

<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dbit_002dccp"></a>
<p>Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees and propagate
pointer alignment information.
This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.  It requires that <samp>-ftree-ccp</samp> is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-ccp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dccp"></a>

at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-switch-conversion</code></dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-tail-merge</code></dt>
<dd><p>Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one with a jump to the
other.  This optimization is known as tail merging or cross jumping.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.  The compilation time
in this pass can
be limited using <samp>max-tail-merge-comparisons</samp> parameter and
<samp>max-tail-merge-iterations</samp> parameter.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-dce</code></dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-builtin-call-dce</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dbuiltin_002dcall_002ddce"></a>
<p>Perform conditional dead code elimination (DCE) for calls to builtin functions
that may set <code>errno</code> but are otherwise side-effect free.  This flag is
enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher if <samp>-Os</samp> is not also
specified.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-dominator-opts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002ddominator_002dopts"></a>
<p>Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-dse</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002ddse"></a>
<p>Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location that is later overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This
flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-ch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dch"></a>
<p>Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.  It is not enabled
for <samp>-Os</samp>, since it usually increases code size.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-optimize</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002doptimize"></a>
<p>Perform loop optimizations on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-linear</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002dlinear"></a>
<p>Perform loop interchange transformations on tree.  Same as
<samp>-floop-interchange</samp>.  To use this code transformation, GCC has
to be configured with <samp>--with-ppl</samp> and <samp>--with-cloog</samp> to
enable the Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-floop-interchange</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-floop_002dinterchange"></a>
<p>Perform loop interchange transformations on loops.  Interchanging two
nested loops switches the inner and outer loops.  For example, given a
loop like:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO J = 1, M
  DO I = 1, N
    A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
  ENDDO
ENDDO
</pre></div>
<p>loop interchange will transform the loop as if the user had written:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO I = 1, N
  DO J = 1, M
    A(J, I) = A(J, I) * C
  ENDDO
ENDDO
</pre></div>
<p>which can be beneficial when <code>N</code> is larger than the caches,
because in Fortran, the elements of an array are stored in memory
contiguously by column, and the original loop iterates over rows,
potentially creating at each access a cache miss.  This optimization
applies to all the languages supported by GCC and is not limited to
Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC has to be configured
with <samp>--with-ppl</samp> and <samp>--with-cloog</samp> to enable the
Graphite loop transformation infrastructure.

</dd>
<dt><code>-floop-strip-mine</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-floop_002dstrip_002dmine"></a>
<p>Perform loop strip mining transformations on loops.  Strip mining
splits a loop into two nested loops.  The outer loop has strides
equal to the strip size and the inner loop has strides of the
original loop within a strip.  The strip length can be changed
using the <samp>loop-block-tile-size</samp> parameter.  For example,
given a loop like:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO I = 1, N
  A(I) = A(I) + C
ENDDO
</pre></div>
<p>loop strip mining will transform the loop as if the user had written:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO II = 1, N, 51
  DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
    A(I) = A(I) + C
  ENDDO
ENDDO
</pre></div>
<p>This optimization applies to all the languages supported by GCC and is
not limited to Fortran.  To use this code transformation, GCC has to
be configured with <samp>--with-ppl</samp> and <samp>--with-cloog</samp> to

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-floop-block</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-floop_002dblock"></a>
<p>Perform loop blocking transformations on loops.  Blocking strip mines
each loop in the loop nest such that the memory accesses of the
element loops fit inside caches.  The strip length can be changed
using the <samp>loop-block-tile-size</samp> parameter.  For example, given
a loop like:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO I = 1, N
  DO J = 1, M
    A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
  ENDDO
ENDDO
</pre></div>
<p>loop blocking will transform the loop as if the user had written:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO II = 1, N, 51
  DO JJ = 1, M, 51
    DO I = II, min (II + 50, N)
      DO J = JJ, min (JJ + 50, M)
        A(J, I) = B(I) + C(J)
      ENDDO
    ENDDO
  ENDDO
ENDDO
</pre></div>
<p>which can be beneficial when <code>M</code> is larger than the caches,
because the innermost loop will iterate over a smaller amount of data
which can be kept in the caches.  This optimization applies to all the
languages supported by GCC and is not limited to Fortran.  To use this
code transformation, GCC has to be configured with <samp>--with-ppl</samp>
and <samp>--with-cloog</samp> to enable the Graphite loop transformation
infrastructure.

<dd><a name="index-fgraphite_002didentity"></a>
<p>Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
<samp>-fgraphite-identity</samp> we can check the costs or benefits of the
GIMPLE -&gt; GRAPHITE -&gt; GIMPLE transformation.  Some minimal optimizations
are also performed by the code generator CLooG, like index splitting and
dead code elimination in loops.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-floop-flatten</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-floop_002dflatten"></a>
<p>Removes the loop nesting structure: transforms the loop nest into a
single loop.  This transformation can be useful as an enablement
transform for vectorization and parallelization.  This feature
is experimental.
To use this code transformation, GCC has to be configured

<dt><code>-ftree-loop-if-convert</code></dt>
<dd><p>Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from

if vectorization is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-if-convert-stores</code></dt>
<dd><p>Attempt to also if-convert conditional jumps containing memory writes.
This transformation can be unsafe for multi-threaded programs as it

  if (cond)
    A[i] = expr;
</pre></div>

</pre></div>
<p>potentially producing data races.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-distribution</code></dt>
<dd><p>Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop

<dd><p>Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with
calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
<p>This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to

</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">DO I = 1, N
  A(I) = 0
  B(I) = A(I) + I
ENDDO
</pre></div>

DO I = 1, N

<p>and the initialization loop is transformed into a call to memset zero.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-im</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002dim"></a>
<p>Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
would be hard to handle at RTL level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With <samp>-funswitch-loops</samp> it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-ivcanon</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002divcanon"></a>
<p>Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fivopts</code></dt>

<dt><code>-ftree-parallelize-loops=n</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dparallelize_002dloops"></a>
<p>Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies <samp>-pthread</samp>, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for <samp>-pthread</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-pta</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dpta"></a>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-copyrename</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dcopyrename"></a>
<p>Perform copy renaming on trees.  This pass attempts to rename compiler
temporaries to other variables at copy locations, usually resulting in
variable names which more closely resemble the original variables.  This flag
is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-ter</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dter"></a>
<p>Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA-&gt;normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better RTL generation.  This is
enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.

</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-vect-loop-version</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dvect_002dloop_002dversion"></a>
<p>Perform loop versioning when doing loop vectorization on trees.  When a loop
appears to be vectorizable except that data alignment or data dependence cannot
be determined at compile time, then vectorized and non-vectorized versions of
the loop are generated along with run-time checks for alignment or dependence
to control which version is executed.  This option is enabled by default

<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dvrp"></a>
<p>Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is
enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.  Null pointer check
elimination is only done if <samp>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</samp> is
enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftracer</code></dt>

<dt><code>-funroll-loops</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-funroll_002dloops"></a>
<p>Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile
time or upon entry to the loop.  <samp>-funroll-loops</samp> implies
<samp>-frerun-cse-after-loop</samp>.  This option makes code larger,

<dd><a name="index-funroll_002dall_002dloops"></a>
<p>Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
<samp>-funroll-all-loops</samp> implies the same options as
<samp>-funroll-loops</samp>,
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsplit_002divs_002din_002dunroller"></a>
<p>Enables expressing of values of induction variables in later iterations
of the unrolled loop using the value in the first iteration.  This breaks
long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
</p>
<p>Combination of <samp>-fweb</samp> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However in cases the loop body is more complicated than
a single basic block, this is not reliable.  It also does not work at all
on some of the architectures due to restrictions in the CSE pass.
</p>
<p>This optimization is enabled by default.

<dt><code>-fvariable-expansion-in-unroller</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvariable_002dexpansion_002din_002dunroller"></a>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fpartial-inlining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpartial_002dinlining"></a>
<p>Inline parts of functions.  This option has any effect only

<p>Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.

heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by &lsquo;<samp>__builtin_expect</samp>&rsquo;, then the heuristics will be
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the &lsquo;<samp>__builtin_expect</samp>&rsquo; info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and &lsquo;<samp>__builtin_expect</samp>&rsquo; can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects

<dt><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstrict_002daliasing"></a>
<p>Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.
</p>
<a name="Type_002dpunning"></a><p>Pay special attention to code like this:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">union a_union {
  int i;
  double d;
};

int f() {
  union a_union t;
  t.d = 3.0;
  return t.i;
}
</pre></div>
<p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called &ldquo;type-punning&rdquo;) is common.  Even with
<samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above will work as
expected.  See <a href="Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation.html#Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation">Structures unions enumerations and bit-fields implementation</a>.  However, this code might not:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int f() {
  union a_union t;
  int* ip;
  t.d = 3.0;
  ip = &amp;t.i;
  return *ip;
}
</pre></div>

<p>Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int f() {
  double d = 3.0;
  return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i;
}

</dd>
<dt><code>-fstrict-overflow</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstrict_002doverflow"></a>
<p>Allow the compiler to assume strict signed overflow rules, depending
on the language being compiled.  For C (and C++) this means that
overflow when doing arithmetic with signed numbers is undefined, which
means that the compiler may assume that it will not happen.  This
permits various optimizations.  For example, the compiler will assume
that an expression like <code>i + 10 &gt; i</code> will always be true for
signed <code>i</code>.  This assumption is only valid if signed overflow is
undefined, as the expression is false if <code>i + 10</code> overflows when
using twos complement arithmetic.  When this option is in effect any
attempt to determine whether an operation on signed numbers will
overflow must be written carefully to not actually involve overflow.
</p>
<p>This option also allows the compiler to assume strict pointer
semantics: given a pointer to an object, if adding an offset to that
pointer does not produce a pointer to the same object, the addition is
undefined.  This permits the compiler to conclude that <code>p + u &gt;
p</code> is always true for a pointer <code>p</code> and unsigned integer
<code>u</code>.  This assumption is only valid because pointer wraparound is
undefined, as the expression is false if <code>p + u</code> overflows using
twos complement arithmetic.
</p>
<p>See also the <samp>-fwrapv</samp> option.  Using <samp>-fwrapv</samp> means
that integer signed overflow is fully defined: it wraps.  When
<samp>-fwrapv</samp> is used, there is no difference between
<samp>-fstrict-overflow</samp> and <samp>-fno-strict-overflow</samp> for
integers.  With <samp>-fwrapv</samp> certain types of overflow are
permitted.  For example, if the compiler gets an overflow when doing
arithmetic on constants, the overflowed value can still be used with
<samp>-fwrapv</samp>, but not otherwise.
</p>
<p>The <samp>-fstrict-overflow</samp> option is enabled at levels
<samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.

<p>Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being

and those merged by attribute <code>externally_visible</code> become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers. If <code>gold</code> is used as the linker plugin, <code>externally_visible</code> attributes are automatically added to functions (not variable yet due to a current <code>gold</code> issue) that are accessed outside of LTO objects according to resolution file produced by <code>gold</code>.  For other linkers that cannot generate resolution file, explicit <code>externally_visible</code> attributes are still necessary.
While this option is equivalent to proper use of the <code>static</code> keyword for
programs consisting of a single file, in combination with option
<samp>-flto</samp> this flag can be used to
compile many smaller scale programs since the functions and variables become
local for the whole combined compilation unit, not for the single source file
itself.
</p>
<p>This option implies <samp>-fwhole-file</samp> for Fortran programs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flto[=<var>n</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flto"></a>
<p>This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC&rsquo;s internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.
</p>
<p>To use the link-time optimizer, <samp>-flto</samp> needs to be specified at
compile time and during the final link.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
</pre></div>

<p>The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation
of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <samp>foo.o</samp> and
<samp>bar.o</samp>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from
<samp>foo.o</samp> and <samp>bar.o</samp>, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
<samp>foo.o</samp> and <samp>bar.o</samp> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
<samp>bar.o</samp> into functions in <samp>foo.o</samp> and vice-versa.
</p>
<p>Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
</pre></div>

<p>The above generates bytecode for <samp>foo.c</samp> and <samp>bar.c</samp>,
merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce <samp>myprog</samp>.
</p>
<p>The only important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations the <samp>-flto</samp> flag needs to be passed to both the
compile and the link commands.
</p>
<p>To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp>) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.
</p>
<p>Note that when a file is compiled with <samp>-flto</samp>, the generated
object file is larger than a regular object file because it 
contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual final code.  This means that
object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object
files; if <samp>-flto</samp> is not passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the optimization flags used to compile individual files
are not necessarily related to those used at link time.  For instance,
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -c -O0 -flto foo.c
gcc -c -O0 -flto bar.c
gcc -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o
</pre></div>

<p>This produces individual object files with unoptimized assembler
code, but the resulting binary <samp>myprog</samp> is optimized at
<samp>-O3</samp>.  If, instead, the final binary is generated without
<samp>-flto</samp>, then <samp>myprog</samp> is not optimized.
</p>
<p>When producing the final binary with <samp>-flto</samp>, GCC only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC automatically selects
which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without
further processing.
</p>
<p>There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link
stage.  Currently, the following options are saved into the GIMPLE
bytecode files: <samp>-fPIC</samp>, <samp>-fcommon</samp> and all the
<samp>-m</samp> target flags.
</p>
<p>At link time, these options are read in and reapplied.  Note that the
current implementation makes no attempt to recognize conflicting
values for these options.  If different files have conflicting option
values (e.g., one file is compiled with <samp>-fPIC</samp> and another
isn&rsquo;t), the compiler simply uses the last value read from the
bytecode files.  It is recommended, then, that you compile all the files
participating in the same link with the same options.
</p>
<p>If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.
</p>
<p>Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages.  This requires
support in the language front end.  Currently, the C, C++ and
Fortran front ends are capable of emitting GIMPLE bytecodes, so
something like this should work:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -c -flto foo.c
g++ -c -flto bar.cc
gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that the final link is done with <code>g++</code> to get the C++
runtime libraries and <samp>-lgfortran</samp> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation; all you need to add is <samp>-flto</samp> to
all the compile and link commands.
</p>
<p>If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
<samp>libfoo.a</samp>, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To enable this feature, use
the flag <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp> at link time:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo
</pre></div>

<p>With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
GIMPLE files from <samp>libfoo.a</samp> and passes them on to the running GCC
to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.
</p>
<p>If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <samp>libfoo.a</samp>
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the LTO optimization process.
</p>
<p>Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <samp>-flto</samp> and <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp>).
</p>
<p>The current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
GCC will not work with an older/newer version of GCC.
</p>
<p>Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information.  Combining <samp>-flto</samp> with
<samp>-g</samp> is currently experimental and expected to produce wrong
results.
</p>
<p>If you specify the optional <var>n</var>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <var>n</var>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <code>make</code> program.  The
environment variable <code>MAKE</code> may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for <var>n</var> is 1.
</p>
<p>You can also specify <samp>-flto=jobserver</samp> to use GNU make&rsquo;s
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if <code>MAKE</code> is
GNU make.

the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <code>double</code> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use <samp>-ffloat-store</samp> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.

</dd>
<dt><code>-fexcess-precision=<var>style</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fexcess_002dprecision"></a>
<p>This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point registers have more precision than the IEEE
<code>float</code> and <code>double</code> types and the processor does not
support operations rounding to those types.  By default,
<samp>-fexcess-precision=fast</samp> is in effect; this means that
operations are carried out in the precision of the registers and that
it is unpredictable when rounding to the types specified in the source
code takes place.  When compiling C, if
<samp>-fexcess-precision=standard</samp> is specified then excess
precision will follow the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas <samp>-ffloat-store</samp> only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as <samp>-std=c99</samp> is used.
</p>
<a name="index-mfpmath"></a>
<p><samp>-fexcess-precision=standard</samp> is not implemented for languages
other than C, and has no effect if
<samp>-funsafe-math-optimizations</samp> or <samp>-ffast-math</samp> is
specified.  On the x86, it also has no effect if <samp>-mfpmath=sse</samp>
or <samp>-mfpmath=sse+387</samp> is specified; in the former case, IEEE
semantics apply without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding
is unpredictable.

<p>Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the ISO C and C++ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  NOTE: re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
<code>(x + 2**52) - 2**52</code>.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both <samp>-fno-signed-zeros</samp> and
<samp>-fno-trapping-math</samp> be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn&rsquo;t make
much sense with <samp>-frounding-math</samp>. For Fortran the option
is automatically enabled when both <samp>-fno-signed-zeros</samp> and

distinct +0.0 and -0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with <samp>-ffinite-math-only</samp>).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn&rsquo;t significant.

truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the FP rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a
non-default rounding mode.  This option disables constant folding of
floating-point expressions at compile time (which may be affected by
rounding mode) and arithmetic transformations that are unsafe in the
presence of sign-dependent rounding modes.

<p>The following options control optimizations that may improve
performance, but are not enabled by any <samp>-O</samp> options.  This
section includes experimental options that may produce broken code.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fbranch-probabilities</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fbranch_002dprobabilities"></a>
<p>After running a program compiled with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>
(see <a href="Debugging-Options.html#Debugging-Options">Options for Debugging Your Program or
<code>gcc</code></a>), you can compile it a second time using
<samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When the program
compiled with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp> exits it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <samp><var>sourcename</var>.gcda</samp> for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>, GCC puts a
&lsquo;<samp>REG_BR_PROB</samp>&rsquo; note on each &lsquo;<samp>JUMP_INSN</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>CALL_INSN</samp>&rsquo;.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <samp>reorg.c</samp>, instead of guessing which path a
branch is most likely to take, the &lsquo;<samp>REG_BR_PROB</samp>&rsquo; values are used to
exactly determine which path is taken more often.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fprofile-values</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fprofile_002dvalues"></a>
<p>If combined with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>, it adds code so that some
data about values of expressions in the program is gathered.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>, it reads back the data gathered
from profiling values of expressions for usage in optimizations.
</p>
<p>Enabled with <samp>-fprofile-generate</samp> and <samp>-fprofile-use</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fvpt</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fvpt"></a>
<p>If combined with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>, it instructs the compiler to add
a code to gather information about values of expressions.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>, it reads back the data gathered
and actually performs the optimizations based on them.
Currently the optimizations include specialization of division operation
using the knowledge about the value of the denominator.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-frename-registers</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-frename_002dregisters"></a>
<p>Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
will most benefit processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables will no longer stay in
a &ldquo;home register&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default with <samp>-funroll-loops</samp> and <samp>-fpeel-loops</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftracer</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftracer-1"></a>
<p>Perform tail duplication to enlarge superblock size.  This transformation
simplifies the control flow of the function allowing other optimizations to do
better job.

<p>Enabled with <samp>-fprofile-use</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-funroll-loops</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-funroll_002dloops-1"></a>
<p>Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  <samp>-funroll-loops</samp> implies
<samp>-frerun-cse-after-loop</samp>, <samp>-fweb</samp> and <samp>-frename-registers</samp>.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with
small constant number of iterations).  This option makes code larger, and may
or may not make it run faster.
</p>
<p>Enabled with <samp>-fprofile-use</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-funroll-all-loops</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-funroll_002dall_002dloops-1"></a>
<p>Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when
the loop is entered.  This usually makes programs run more slowly.
<samp>-funroll-all-loops</samp> implies the same options as
<samp>-funroll-loops</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fpeel-loops</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fpeel_002dloops"></a>
<p>Peels loops for which there is enough information that they do not
roll much (from profile feedback).  It also turns on complete loop peeling
(i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant number of iterations).
</p>
<p>Enabled with <samp>-fprofile-use</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmove-loop-invariants</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmove_002dloop_002dinvariants"></a>
<p>Enables the loop invariant motion pass in the RTL loop optimizer.  Enabled
at level <samp>-O1</samp>
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-funswitch-loops</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-funswitch_002dloops"></a>
<p>Move branches with loop invariant conditions out of the loop, with duplicates
of the loop on both branches (modified according to result of the condition).
</p>

<dt><code>-ffunction-sections</code></dt>
<dt><code>-fdata-sections</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffunction_002dsections"></a>
<a name="index-fdata_002dsections"></a>
<p>Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section&rsquo;s name
in the output file.
</p>
<p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations
to improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems
using the ELF object format and SPARC processors running Solaris 2 have
linkers with such optimizations.  AIX may have these optimizations in
the future.
</p>
<p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing
so.  When you specify these options, the assembler and linker will
create larger object and executable files and will also be slower.
You will not be able to use <code>gprof</code> on all systems if you
specify this option and you may have problems with debugging if
you specify both this option and <samp>-g</samp>.

<p>Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue
threading.
The use of target registers can typically be exposed only during reload,
thus hoisting loads out of loops and doing inter-block scheduling needs
a separate optimization pass.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fbranch-target-load-optimize2</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fbranch_002dtarget_002dload_002doptimize2"></a>

<p>When performing branch target register load optimization, don&rsquo;t reuse
branch target registers in within any basic block.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstack-protector</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstack_002dprotector"></a>
<p>Emit extra code to check for buffer overflows, such as stack smashing
attacks.  This is done by adding a guard variable to functions with
vulnerable objects.  This includes functions that call alloca, and
functions with buffers larger than 8 bytes.  The guards are initialized
when a function is entered and then checked when the function exits.
If a guard check fails, an error message is printed and the program exits.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fstack-protector-all</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstack_002dprotector_002dall"></a>
<p>Like <samp>-fstack-protector</samp> except that all functions are protected.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsection-anchors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsection_002danchors"></a>
<p>Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on some
targets.
</p>
<p>For example, the implementation of the following function <code>foo</code>:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">static int a, b, c;
int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }
</pre></div>

<p>would usually calculate the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <samp>-fsection-anchors</samp>, it will access the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn&rsquo;t valid C):
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int foo (void)
{
  register int *xr = &amp;x;
  return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];
}
</pre></div>

<p>Not all targets support this option.

<dt><code>--param <var>name</var>=<var>value</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-param"></a>
<p>In some places, GCC uses various constants to control the amount of
optimization that is done.  For example, GCC will not inline functions
that contain more than a certain number of instructions.  You can
control some of these constants on the command line using the
<samp>--param</samp> option.

<dt><code>max-crossjump-edges</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for crossjumping.
The algorithm used by <samp>-fcrossjumping</samp> is <em>O(N^2)</em> in
the number of edges incoming to each block.  Increasing values mean
more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>min-crossjump-insns</code></dt>
<dd><p>The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end
of two blocks before crossjumping will be performed on them.  This

crossjumped from are matched.  The default value is 5.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-grow-copy-bb-insns</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum code size expansion factor when copying basic blocks
instead of jumping.  The expansion is relative to a jump instruction.
The default value is 8.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-goto-duplication-insns</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps
to a computed goto.  To avoid <em>O(N^2)</em> behavior in a number of
passes, GCC factors computed gotos early in the compilation process,
and unfactors them as late as possible.  Only computed jumps at the
end of a basic blocks with no more than max-goto-duplication-insns are
unfactored.  The default value is 8.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-delay-slot-insn-search</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an
instruction to fill a delay slot.  If more than this arbitrary number of
instructions is searched, the time savings from filling the delay slot
will be minimal so stop searching.  Increasing values mean more
aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-delay-slot-live-search</code></dt>
<dd><p>When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to
consider when searching for a block with valid live register
information.  Increasing this arbitrarily chosen value means more
aggressive optimization, increasing the compilation time.  This parameter
should be removed when the delay slot code is rewritten to maintain the
control-flow graph.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-gcse-memory</code></dt>
<dd><p>The approximate maximum amount of memory that will be allocated in
order to perform the global common subexpression elimination
optimization.  If more memory than specified is required, the
optimization will not be done.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-gcse-insertion-ratio</code></dt>
<dd><p>If the ratio of expression insertions to deletions is larger than this value

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-pending-list-length</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of pending dependencies scheduling will allow

needlessly consume memory and resources.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-modulo-backtrack-attempts</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of backtrack attempts the scheduler should make
when modulo scheduling a loop.  Larger values can exponentially increase
compilation time.

<dd><p>Several parameters control the tree inliner used in gcc.
This number sets the maximum number of instructions (counted in GCC&rsquo;s
internal representation) in a single function that the tree inliner

The default value is 400.

<dd><p>When you use <samp>-finline-functions</samp> (included in <samp>-O3</samp>),
a lot of functions that would otherwise not be considered for inlining

<dt><code>large-function-insns</code></dt>
<dd><p>The limit specifying really large functions.  For functions larger than this

The default value is 2700.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>large-function-growth</code></dt>

units larger than this limit is limited by <samp>--param inline-unit-growth</samp>.
For small units this might be too tight (consider unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three time.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions however the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to <samp>--param large-unit-insns</samp>

<samp>ipa-sra-ptr-growth-factor</samp> times the size of the original
pointer parameter.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tm-max-aggregate-size</code></dt>
<dd><p>When making copies of thread-local variables in a transaction, this
parameter specifies the size in bytes after which variables will be
saved with the logging functions as opposed to save/restore code
sequence pairs.  This option only applies when using
<samp>-fgnu-tm</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>graphite-max-nb-scop-params</code></dt>
<dd><p>To avoid exponential effects in the Graphite loop transforms, the
number of parameters in a Static Control Part (SCoP) is bounded.  The
default value is 10 parameters.  A variable whose value is unknown at
compilation time and defined outside a SCoP is a parameter of the SCoP.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>graphite-max-bbs-per-function</code></dt>
<dd><p>To avoid exponential effects in the detection of SCoPs, the size of
the functions analyzed by Graphite is bounded.  The default value is
100 basic blocks.

</dd>
<dt><code>loop-block-tile-size</code></dt>
<dd><p>Loop blocking or strip mining transforms, enabled with
<samp>-floop-block</samp> or <samp>-floop-strip-mine</samp>, strip mine each
loop in the loop nest by a given number of iterations.  The strip
length can be changed using the <samp>loop-block-tile-size</samp>
parameter.  The default value is 51 iterations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ipa-cp-value-list-size</code></dt>
<dd><p>IPA-CP attempts to track all possible values and types passed to a function&rsquo;s
parameter in order to propagate them and perform devirtualization.
<samp>ipa-cp-value-list-size</samp> is the maximum number of values and types it
stores per one formal parameter of a function.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>lto-partitions</code></dt>
<dd><p>Specify desired number of partitions produced during WHOPR compilation.
The number of partitions should exceed the number of CPUs used for compilation.
The default value is 32.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>lto-minpartition</code></dt>
<dd><p>Size of minimal partition for WHOPR (in estimated instructions).
This prevents expenses of splitting very small programs into too many
partitions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>cxx-max-namespaces-for-diagnostic-help</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of namespaces to consult for suggestions when C++
name lookup fails for an identifier.  The default is 1000.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sink-frequency-threshold</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum relative execution frequency (in percents) of the target block
relative to a statement&rsquo;s original block to allow statement sinking of a
statement.  Larger numbers result in more aggressive statement sinking.
The default value is 75.  A small positive adjustment is applied for
statements with memory operands as those are even more profitable so sink.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>max-stores-to-sink</code></dt>
<dd><p>The maximum number of conditional stores paires that can be sunk.  Set to 0
if either vectorization (<samp>-ftree-vectorize</samp>) or if-conversion
(<samp>-ftree-loop-if-convert</samp>) is disabled.  The default is 2.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>allow-load-data-races</code></dt>
<dd><p>Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on loads.
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
unless implicitly set by the <samp>-fmemory-model=</samp> option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>allow-store-data-races</code></dt>
<dd><p>Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on stores.
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
unless implicitly set by the <samp>-fmemory-model=</samp> option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>allow-packed-load-data-races</code></dt>
<dd><p>Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data loads.
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
unless implicitly set by the <samp>-fmemory-model=</samp> option.

<dt><code>allow-packed-store-data-races</code></dt>
<dd><p>Allow optimizers to introduce new data races on packed data stores.
Set to 1 to allow, otherwise to 0.  This option is enabled by default
unless implicitly set by the <samp>-fmemory-model=</samp> option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>case-values-threshold</code></dt>
<dd><p>The smallest number of different values for which it is best to use a
jump-table instead of a tree of conditional branches.  If the value is
0, use the default for the machine.  The default is 0.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tree-reassoc-width</code></dt>
<dd><p>Set the maximum number of instructions executed in parallel in
reassociated tree. This parameter overrides target dependent
heuristics used by default if has non zero value.
