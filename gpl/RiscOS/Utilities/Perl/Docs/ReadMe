This archive contains the source files for the RISC OS port (v1.51) of Perl
5.001 for those who wish to recompile it on their own machines.  They are
part of the full distribution so please read the documentation for that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.51 does NOT include internet support, since it did not work. Please
note Luke's comments below on the Utils library and the stat header. This
release is supplied by me with the agreement of Luke.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unlike version 1.0, UnixLib is no longer used, but you will need a copy of
Paul Moore's Utils library which is available from hensa (a043.arc) and
probably other archives. The file sys/stat.h from this has been slightly
altered (some extra fields added) to keep perl 5 happy and is included here.
If you want to compile in the socket interface then you'll need a copy of
NetLib too. This probably won't work anyway so you can leave it out and
undefine the symbols HAS_SOCKET,I_NET_ERRNO and I_SYS_IOCTL which are in
config.h.

Please send any bugfixes, additions or suggestions to me rather than
distributing other copies.

Luke.
