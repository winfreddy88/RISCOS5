Zero is a zero length file for testing the filetests.

*CAREFULL* ChopExt chops off / extensions from the CSD. It
could seriously damage the health of your DOS partition, for
instance.

Script checkfor checks all the files in the CSD for a specified string.
It is thus similar to Acorn's find, but easier to use IMHO.

There are test scripts in tests, and other examples in Examples. You
will need to change the filenames in filetest.
