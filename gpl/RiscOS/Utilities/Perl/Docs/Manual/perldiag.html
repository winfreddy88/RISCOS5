<TITLE> PERLDIAG </TITLE>
<h2>NAME</h2>
perldiag - various Perl diagnostics
<p><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing order of
desperation):
<p><pre>
        (W) A warning (optional).
        (D) A deprecation (optional).
        (S) A severe warning (mandatory).
        (F) A fatal error (trappable).
        (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
        (X) A very fatal error (non-trappable).
</pre>
Optional warnings are enabled by using the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_362">-w</A>
 switch.  Trappable
errors may be trapped using the eval operator.  See perlfunc/eval.
<p>Some of these messages are generic.  Spots that vary are denoted with a %s,
just as in a printf format.  Note that some message start with a %s!
The symbols <B>"%-?@</B> sort before the letters, while <B>[</B> and <B>\</B> sort after.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><B>"my" variable %s can't be in a package</B>
<dd>
(F) Lexically scoped variables aren't in a package, so it doesn't make sense
to try to declare one with a package qualifier on the front.  Use local()
if you want to localize a package variable.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>"no" not allowed in expression</B>
<dd>
(F) The "no" keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns
no useful value.  See 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">
the perlmod manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>"use" not allowed in expression</B>
<dd>
(F) The "use" keyword is recognized and executed at compile time, and returns
no useful value.  See 
<A HREF="perlmod.html">
the perlmod manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>% may only be used in unpack</B>
<dd>
(F) You can't pack a string by supplying a checksum, since the
checksumming process loses information, and you can't go the other
way.  See perlfunc/unpack.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>%s (...) interpreted as function</B>
<dd>
(W) You've run afoul of the rule that says that any list operator followed
by parentheses turns into a function, with all the list operators arguments 
found inside the parens.  See perlop/Terms and List Operators (Leftward).
<p></dd>
<dt><B>%s argument is not a HASH element</B>
<dd>
(F) The argument to delete() or exists() must be a hash element, such as
<p></dd>
<pre>
        $foo{$bar}
        $ref-&gt;[12]-&gt;{"susie"}
</pre>
<dt><B>%s did not return a true value</B>
<dd>
(F) A required (or used) file must return a true value to indicate that
it compiled correctly and ran its initialization code correctly.  It's
traditional to end such a file with a "1;", though any true value would
do.  See perlfunc/require.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>%s found where operator expected</B>
<dd>
(S) The Perl lexer knows whether to expect a term or an operator.  If it
sees what it knows to be a term when it was expecting to see an operator,
it gives you this warning.  Usually it indicates that an operator or
delimiter was omitted, such as a semicolon.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>%s had compilation errors.</B>
<dd>
(F) The final summary message when a <B>perl -c</B> fails.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>%s has too many errors.</B>
<dd>
(F) The parser has given up trying to parse the program after 10 errors.
Further error messages would likely be uninformative.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>%s matches null string many times</B>
<dd>
(W) The pattern you've specified would be an infinite loop if the
regular expression engine didn't specifically check for that.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the perlre manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>%s never introduced</B>
<dd>
(S) The symbol in question was declared but somehow went out of scope
before it could possibly have been used.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>%s syntax OK</B>
<dd>
(F) The final summary message when a <B>perl -c</B> succeeds.
<p></dd>
<dt><B><A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_355">-P</A>  not allowed for setuid/setgid script</B>
<dd>
(F) The script would have to be opened by the C preprocessor by name,
which provides a race condition that breaks security.
<p></dd>
<dt><B><A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_358">-T</A>  and <B>-B</B> not implemented on filehandles</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl can't peek at the stdio buffer of filehandles when it doesn't
know about your kind of stdio.  You'll have to use a filename instead.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>?+* follows nothing in regexp</B>
<dd>
(F) You started a regular expression with a quantifier.  Backslash it
if you meant it literally.   See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the perlre manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>@ outside of string</B>
<dd>
(F) You had a pack template that specified an absolution position outside
the string being unpacked.  See perlfunc/pack.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>accept() on closed fd</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your socket() call?  See perlfunc/accept.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Allocation too large: %lx</B>
<dd>
(F) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MSDOS machine.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Arg too short for msgsnd</B>
<dd>
(F) msgsnd() requires a string at least as long as sizeof(long).
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Args must match #! line</B>
<dd>
(F) The setuid emulator requires that the arguments Perl was invoked
with match the arguments specified on the #! line.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Argument "%s" isn't numeric</B>
<dd>
(W) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator that
expected a numeric value instead.  If you're fortunate the message
will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Array @%s missing the @ in argument %d of %s()</B>
<dd>
(D) Really old Perl let you omit the @ on array names in some spots.  This
is now heavily deprecated.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>assertion botched: %s</B>
<dd>
(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Assertion failed: file "%s"</B>
<dd>
(P) A general assertion failed.  The file in question must be examined.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Assignment to both a list and a scalar</B>
<dd>
(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
must either both be scalars or both be lists.  Otherwise Perl won't
know which context to supply to the right side.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Attempt to free non-arena SV: 0x%lx</B>
<dd>
(P) All SV objects are supposed to be allocated from arenas that will
be garbage collected on exit.  An SV was discovered to be outside any
of those arenas.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Attempt to free temp prematurely</B>
<dd>
(W) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the free_tmps()
routine.  This indicates that something else is freeing the SV before
the free_tmps() routine gets a chance, which means that the free_tmps()
routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar when it does try to free
it.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Attempt to free unreferenced glob pointers</B>
<dd>
(P) The reference counts got screwed up on symbol aliases.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Attempt to free unreferenced scalar</B>
<dd>
(W) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see if it
would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier,
and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed.  This
could indicate that SvREFCNT_dec() was called too many times, or that
SvREFCNT_inc() was called too few times, or that the SV was mortalized
when it shouldn't have been, or that memory has been corrupted.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Bad arg length for %s, is %d, should be %d</B>
<dd>
(F) You passed a buffer of the wrong size to one of msgctl(), semctl() or
shmctl().  In C parlance, the correct sized are, respectively,
sizeof(struct msqid_ds *), sizeof(struct semid_ds *) and
sizeof(struct shmid_ds *).
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Bad associative array</B>
<dd>
(P) One of the internal hash routines was passed a null HV pointer.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Bad filehandle: %s</B>
<dd>
(F) A symbol was passed to something wanting a filehandle, but the symbol
has no filehandle associated with it.  Perhaps you didn't do an open(), or
did it in another package.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Bad free() ignored</B>
<dd>
(S) An internal routine called free() on something that had never been
malloc()ed in the first place.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Bad name after %s::</B>
<dd>
(F) You started to name a symbol by using a package prefix, and then didn't
finish the symbol.  In particular, you can't interpolate outside of quotes,
so
<p></dd>
<pre>
        $var = 'myvar';
        $sym = mypack::$var;
</pre>
is not the same as
<p><pre>
        $var = 'myvar';
        $sym = "mypack::$var";
</pre>
<dt><B>Bad symbol for array</B>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add an array entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Bad symbol for filehandle</B>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add a filehandle entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Bad symbol for hash</B>
<dd>
(P) An internal request asked to add a hash entry to something that
wasn't a symbol table entry.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>BEGIN failed--compilation aborted</B>
<dd>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing a BEGIN subroutine.
Compilation stops immediately and the interpreter is exited.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>bind() on closed fd</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to do a bind on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your socket() call?  See perlfunc/bind.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Callback called exit</B>
<dd>
(F) A subroutine invoked from an external package via perl_call_sv()
exited by calling exit.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't "last" outside a block</B>
<dd>
(F) A "last" statement was executed to break out of the current block,
except that there's this itty bitty problem called there isn't a
current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't count as a
"loopish" block.  You can usually double the curlies to get the same
effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See perlfunc/last.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't "next" outside a block</B>
<dd>
(F) A "next" statement was executed to reiterate the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block.  You can usually double the curlies to get
the same effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See perlfunc/last.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't "redo" outside a block</B>
<dd>
(F) A "redo" statement was executed to restart the current block, but
there isn't a current block.  Note that an "if" or "else" block doesn't
count as a "loopish" block.  You can usually double the curlies to get
the same effect though, since the inner curlies will be considered a block
that loops once.  See perlfunc/last.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't bless non-reference value</B>
<dd>
(F) Only hard references may be blessed.  This is how Perl "enforces"
encapsulation of objects.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the perlobj manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't break at that line</B>
<dd>
(S) A warning intended for while running within the debugger, indicating
the line number specified wasn't the location of a statement that could
be stopped at.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't call method "%s" in empty package "%s"</B>
<dd>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't have ANYTHING defined
in it, let alone methods.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the perlobj manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't call method "%s" on unblessed reference</B>
<dd>
(F) A method call must know what package it's supposed to run in.  It
ordinarily finds this out from the object reference you supply, but
you didn't supply an object reference in this case.  A reference isn't
an object reference until it has been blessed.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the perlobj manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't call method "%s" without a package or object reference</B>
<dd>
(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
object reference or package name contains an expression that returns
neither an object reference nor a package name.  (Perhaps it's null?)
Something like this will reproduce the error:
<p></dd>
<pre>
        $BADREF = undef;
        process $BADREF 1,2,3;
        $BADREF-&gt;process(1,2,3);
</pre>
<dt><B>Can't chdir to %s</B>
<dd>
(F) You called <B>perl -x/foo/bar</B>, but <B>/foo/bar</B> is not a directory
that you can chdir to, possibly because it doesn't exist.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't coerce %s to integer in %s</B>
<dd>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.  So you can't
say things like:
<p></dd>
<pre>
        *foo += 1;
</pre>
You CAN say
<p><pre>
        $foo = *foo;
        $foo += 1;
</pre>
but then $foo no longer contains a glob.
<p><dt><B>Can't coerce %s to number in %s</B>
<dd>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't coerce %s to string in %s</B>
<dd>
(F) Certain types of SVs, in particular real symbol table entries
(type GLOB), can't be forced to stop being what they are.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't create pipe mailbox</B>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't declare %s in my</B>
<dd>
(F) Only scalar, array and hash variables may be declared as lexical variables.
They must have ordinary identifiers as names.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do inplace edit on %s: %s</B>
<dd>
(S) The creation of the new file failed for the indicated reason.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do inplace edit without backup</B>
<dd>
(F) You're on a system such as MSDOS that gets confused if you try reading
from a deleted (but still opened) file.  You have to say 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_350">-i</A>
<B>.bak</B>, or some
such.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do inplace edit: %s &gt; 14 characters</B>
<dd>
(S) There isn't enough room in the filename to make a backup name for the file.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do inplace edit: %s is not a regular file</B>
<dd>
(S) You tried to use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_350">-i</A>
 switch on a special file, such as a file in
/dev, or a FIFO.  The file was ignored.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do setegid!</B>
<dd>
(P) The setegid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator
of suidperl.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do seteuid!</B>
<dd>
(P) The setuid emulator of suidperl failed for some reason.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do setuid</B>
<dd>
(F) This typically means that ordinary perl tried to exec suidperl to
do setuid emulation, but couldn't exec it.  It looks for a name of the
form sperl5.000 in the same directory that the perl executable resides
under the name perl5.000, typically /usr/local/bin on Unix machines.
If the file is there, check the execute permissions.  If it isn't, ask
your sysadmin why he and/or she removed it.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do waitpid with flags</B>
<dd>
(F) This machine doesn't have either waitpid() or wait4(), so only waitpid()
without flags is emulated.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't do {n,m} with n &gt; m</B>
<dd>
(F) Minima must be less than or equal to maxima.  If you really want
your regexp to match something 0 times, just put {0}.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the perlre manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't emulate -%s on #! line</B>
<dd>
(F) The #! line specifies a switch that doesn't make sense at this point.
For example, it'd be kind of silly to put a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_363">-x</A>
 on the #! line.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't exec "%s": %s</B>
<dd>
(W) An system(), exec() or piped open call could not execute the named
program for the indicated reason.  Typical reasons include: the permissions
were wrong on the file, the file wasn't found in <B>$ENV{PATH}</B>, the
executable in question was compiled for another architecture, or the
#! line in a script points to an interpreter that can't be run for
similar reasons.  (Or maybe your system doesn't support #! at all.)
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't exec %s</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to execute the indicated program for you because that's
what the #! line said.  If that's not what you wanted, you may need to
mention "perl" on the #! line somewhere.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't execute %s</B>
<dd>
(F) You used the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_357">-S</A>
 switch, but the script to execute could not be found
in the PATH, or at least not with the correct permissions.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't find label %s</B>
<dd>
(F) You said to goto a label that isn't mentioned anywhere that it's possible
for us to go to.  See perlfunc/goto.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't find string terminator %s anywhere before EOF</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl strings can stretch over multiple lines.  This message means that
the closing delimiter was omitted.  Since bracketed quotes count nesting
levels, the following is missing its final parenthesis:
<p></dd>
<pre>
        print q(The character '(' starts a side comment.)
</pre>
<dt><B>Can't fork</B>
<dd>
(F) A fatal error occurred while trying to fork while opening a pipeline.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't get pipe mailbox device name</B>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't get SYSGEN parameter value for MAXBUF</B>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't goto subroutine outside a subroutine</B>
<dd>
(F) The deeply magical "goto subroutine" call can only replace one subroutine
call for another.  It can't manufacture one out of whole cloth.  In general
you should only be calling it out of an AUTOLOAD routine anyway.  See
perlfunc/goto.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't locate %s in @INC</B>
<dd>
(F) You said to do (or require, or use) a file that couldn't be found
in any of the libraries mentioned in @INC.  Perhaps you need to set
the PERL5LIB environment variable to say where the extra library is,
or maybe the script needs to add the library name to @INC.  Or maybe
you just misspelled the name of the file.  See perlfunc/require.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't locate object method "%s" via package "%s"</B>
<dd>
(F) You called a method correctly, and it correctly indicated a package
functioning as a class, but that package doesn't define that particular
method, nor does any of it's base classes.  See 
<A HREF="perlobj.html">
the perlobj manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't locate package %s for @%s::ISA</B>
<dd>
(W) The @ISA array contained the name of another package that doesn't seem
to exist.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't mktemp()</B>
<dd>
(F) The mktemp() routine failed for some reason while trying to process
a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_348">-e</A>
 switch.  Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't modify %s in %s</B>
<dd>
(F) You aren't allowed to assign to the item indicated, or otherwise try to
change it, such as with an autoincrement.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't modify non-existent substring</B>
<dd>
(P) The internal routine that does assignment to a substr() was handed
a NULL.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't msgrcv to readonly var</B>
<dd>
(F) The target of a msgrcv must be modifiable in order to be used as a receive
buffer.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't open %s: %s</B>
<dd>
(S) An inplace edit couldn't open the original file for the indicated reason.
Usually this is because you don't have read permission for the file.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't open bidirectional pipe</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to say <B>open(CMD, "|cmd|")</B>, which is not supported.  You can
try any of several modules in the Perl library to do this, such as
"open2.pl".  Alternately, direct the pipe's output to a file using ">",
and then read it in under a different file handle.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't open perl script "%s": %s</B>
<dd>
(F) The script you specified can't be opened for the indicated reason.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't rename %s to %s: %s, skipping file</B>
<dd>
(S) The rename done by the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_350">-i</A>
 switch failed for some reason, probably because
you don't have write permission to the directory.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't reswap uid and euid</B>
<dd>
(P) The setreuid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator
of suidperl.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't return outside a subroutine</B>
<dd>
(F) The return statement was executed in mainline code, that is, where
there was no subroutine call to return out of.  See 
<A HREF="perlsub.html">
the perlsub manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't stat script "%s"</B>
<dd>
(P) For some reason you can't fstat() the script even though you have
it open already.  Bizarre.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't swap uid and euid</B>
<dd>
(P) The setreuid() call failed for some reason in the setuid emulator
of suidperl.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't take log of %g</B>
<dd>
(F) Logarithms are only defined on positive real numbers.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't take sqrt of %g</B>
<dd>
(F) For ordinary real numbers, you can't take the square root of a
negative number.  There's a Complex package available for Perl, though,
if you really want to do that.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't undef active subroutine</B>
<dd>
(F) You can't undefine a routine that's currently running.  You can,
however, redefine it while it's running, and you can even undef the
redefined subroutine while the old routine is running.  Go figure.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't unshift</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to unshift an "unreal" array that can't be unshifted, such
as the main Perl stack.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't upgrade that kind of scalar</B>
<dd>
(P) The internal sv_upgrade routine adds "members" to an SV, making
it into a more specialized kind of SV.  The top several SV types are
so specialized, however, that they cannot be interconverted.  This
message indicates that such a conversion was attempted.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't upgrade to undef</B>
<dd>
(P) The undefined SV is the bottom of the totem pole, in the scheme
of upgradability.  Upgrading to undef indicates an error in the
code calling sv_upgrade.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't use %s as left arg of an implicit -&gt;</B>
<dd>
(F) The compiler tried to interpret a bracketed expression as a subscript
to an array reference.  But to the left of the brackets was an expression
that didn't end in an arrow (-&gt;), or look like a subscripted expression.
Only subscripted expressions with multiple subscripts are allowed to omit 
the intervening arrow.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't use %s for loop variable</B>
<dd>
(F) Only a simple scalar variable may be used as a loop variable on a foreach.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't use %s ref as %s ref</B>
<dd>
(F) You've mixed up your reference types.  You have to dereference a
reference of the type needed.  You can use the ref() function to
test the type of the reference, if need be.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't use a string as %s ref while "strict refs" in use</B>
<dd>
(F) Only hard references are allowed by "strict refs".  Symbolic references
are disallowed.  See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the perlref manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't use an undefined value as %s reference</B>
<dd>
(F) A value used as either a hard reference or a symbolic reference must
be a defined value.  This helps to de-lurk some insidious errors.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't use delimiter brackets within expression</B>
<dd>
(F) The ${name} construct is for disambiguating identifiers in strings, not
in ordinary code.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't use global %s in "my"</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to declare a magical variable as a lexical variable.  This is
not allowed, because the magic can only be tied to one location (namely
the global variable) and it would be incredibly confusing to have
variables in your program that looked like magical variables but
weren't.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't write to temp file for  <A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_348">-e</A> : %s</B>
<dd>
(F) The write routine failed for some reason while trying to process
a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_348">-e</A>
 switch.  Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Can't x= to readonly value</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to repeat a constant value (often the undefined value) with
an assignment operator, which implies modifying the value itself.
Perhaps you need to copy the value to a temporary, and repeat that.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Cannot open temporary file</B>
<dd>
(F) The create routine failed for some reaon while trying to process
a 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_348">-e</A>
 switch.  Maybe your /tmp partition is full, or clobbered.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>chmod: mode argument is missing initial 0</B>
<dd>
(W) A novice will sometimes say
<p></dd>
<pre>
        chmod 777, $filename
</pre>
not realizing that 777 will be interpreted as a decimal number, equivalent
to 01411.  Octal constants are introduced with a leading 0 in Perl, as in C.
<p><dt><B>Close on unopened file &lt;%s&gt;</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to close a filehandle that was never opened.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>connect() on closed fd</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to do a connect on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your socket() call?  See perlfunc/connect.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Corrupt malloc ptr 0x%lx at 0x%lx</B>
<dd>
(P) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>corrupted regexp pointers</B>
<dd>
(P) The regular expression engine got confused by what the regular
expression compiler gave it.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>corrupted regexp program</B>
<dd>
(P) The regular expression engine got passed a regexp program without
a valid magic number.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Deep recursion on subroutine "%s"</B>
<dd>
(W) This subroutine has called itself (directly or indirectly) 100
times than it has returned.  This probably indicates an infinite
recursion, unless you're writing strange benchmark programs, in which
case it indicates something else.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Did you mean $ instead of %?</B>
<dd>
(W) You probably said %hash{$key} when you meant $hash{$key}.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Don't know how to handle magic of type '%s'</B>
<dd>
(P) The internal handling of magical variables has been cursed.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>do_study: out of memory</B>
<dd>
(P) This should have been caught by safemalloc() instead.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Duplicate free() ignored</B>
<dd>
(S) An internal routine called free() on something that had already
been freed.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>END failed--cleanup aborted</B>
<dd>
(F) An untrapped exception was raised while executing an END subroutine.
The interpreter is immediately exited.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Execution of %s aborted due to compilation errors.</B>
<dd>
(F) The final summary message when a Perl compilation fails.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Exiting eval via %s</B>
<dd>
(W) You are exiting an eval by unconventional means, such as a
a goto, or a loop control statement.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Exiting subroutine via %s</B>
<dd>
(W) You are exiting a subroutine by unconventional means, such as a
a goto, or a loop control statement.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Exiting substitution via %s</B>
<dd>
(W) You are exiting a substitution by unconventional means, such as a
a return, a goto, or a loop control statement.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Fatal $PUTMSG error: %d</B>
<dd>
(F) An error peculiar to VMS.
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_106">fcntl is not implemented</A></b>
<dd>
(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement fcntl().  What is this, a
PDP-11 or something?
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Filehandle %s never opened</B>
<dd>
(W) An I/O operation was attempted on a filehandle that was never initialized.
You need to do an open() or a socket() call, or call a constructor from
the FileHandle package.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Filehandle %s opened only for input</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you
intended it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with
"+&lt;" or "+&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If you only
intended to write the file, use ">" or &gt;&gt;".  See perlfunc/open.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Filehandle only opened for input</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to write on a read-only filehandle.  If you
intended it to be a read-write filehandle, you needed to open it with
"+&lt;" or "+&gt;" or "&gt;&gt;" instead of with "&lt;" or nothing.  If you only
intended to write the file, use ">" or &gt;&gt;".  See perlfunc/open.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Final $ should be \$ or $name</B>
<dd>
(F) You must now decide whether the final $ in a string was meant to be
a literal dollar sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name
that happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or
the name.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Final @ should be \@ or @name</B>
<dd>
(F) You must now decide whether the final @ in a string was meant to be
a literal "at" sign, or was meant to introduce a variable name
that happens to be missing.  So you have to put either the backslash or
the name.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Format %s redefined</B>
<dd>
(W) You redefined a format.  To suppress this warning, say
<p></dd>
<pre>
        {
        local $^W = 0;
        eval "format NAME =...";
        }
</pre>
<dt><B>Format not terminated</B>
<dd>
(F) A format must be terminated by a line with a solitary dot.  Perl got
to the end of your file without finding such a line.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Found = in conditional, should be ==</B>
<dd>
(W) You said
<p></dd>
<pre>
        if ($foo = 123)
</pre>
when you meant
<p><pre>
        if ($foo == 123)
</pre>
(or something like that).
<p><dt><B>gdbm store returned %d, errno %d, key "%s"</B>
<dd>
(S) A warning from the GDBM_File extension that a store failed.
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_131">gethostent not implemented</A></b>
<dd>
(F) Your C library apparently doesn't implement gethostent(), probably
because if it did, it'd feel morally obligated to return every hostname
on the Internet.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>get{sock,peer}name() on closed fd</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to get a socket or peer socket name on a closed socket.
Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Glob not terminated</B>
<dd>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
the line, and you really meant a "less than".
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Global symbol "%s" requires explicit package name</B>
<dd>
(F) You've said "use strict vars", which indicates that all variables must
either be lexically scoped (using "my"), or explicitly qualified to
say which package the global variable is in (using "::").
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_151">goto must have label</A></b>
<dd>
(F) Unlike with "next" or "last", you're not allowed to goto an
unspecified destination.  See perlfunc/goto.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Had to create %s unexpectedly</B>
<dd>
(S) A routine asked for a symbol from a symbol table that ought to have
existed already, but for some reason it didn't, and had to be created on
an emergency basis to prevent a core dump.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Hash %%s missing the % in argument %d of %s()</B>
<dd>
(D) Really old Perl let you omit the % on hash names in some spots.  This
is now heavily deprecated.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Identifier "%s::%s" used only once: possible typo</B>
<dd>
(W) Typographical errors often show up as unique identifiers.  If you
had a good reason for having a unique identifier, then just mention it
again somehow to suppress the message.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Illegal division by zero</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0.  Either something was wrong in your
logic, or you need to put a conditional in to guard against meaningless input.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Illegal modulus zero</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to divide a number by 0 to get the remainder.  Most numbers
don't take to this kindly.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Illegal octal digit</B>
<dd>
(F) You used an 8 or 9 in a octal number.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Insecure dependency in %s</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to do something that the tainting mechanism didn't like. 
The tainting mechanism is turned on when you're running setuid or setgid,
or when you specify 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_358">-T</A>
 to turn it on explicitly.  The tainting mechanism
labels all data that's derived directly or indirectly from the user,
who is considered to be unworthy of your trust.  If any such data is
used in a "dangerous" operation, you get this error.  See 
<A HREF="perlsec.html">
the perlsec manpage</A>

for more information.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Insecure directory in %s</B>
<dd>
(F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or setgid
script if $ENV{PATH} contains a directory that is writable by the world.
See 
<A HREF="perlsec.html">
the perlsec manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Insecure PATH</B>
<dd>
(F) You can't use system(), exec(), or a piped open in a setuid or
setgid script if $ENV{PATH} is derived from data supplied (or
potentially supplied) by the user.  The script must set the path to a
known value, using trustworthy data.  See 
<A HREF="perlsec.html">
the perlsec manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>internal disaster in regexp</B>
<dd>
(P) Something went badly wrong in the regular expression parser.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>internal urp in regexp at /%s/</B>
<dd>
(P) Something went badly awry in the regular expression parser.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>invalid [] range in regexp</B>
<dd>
(F) The range specified in a character class had a minimum character
greater than the maximum character.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the perlre manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_157">ioctl is not implemented</A></b>
<dd>
(F) Your machine apparently doesn't implement ioctl(), which is pretty
strange for a machine that supports C.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>junk on end of regexp</B>
<dd>
(P) The regular expression parser is confused.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Label not found for "last %s"</B>
<dd>
(F) You named a loop to break out of, but you're not currently in a
loop of that name, not even if you count where you were called from.
See perlfunc/last.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Label not found for "next %s"</B>
<dd>
(F) You named a loop to continue, but you're not currently in a loop of
that name, not even if you count where you were called from.  See
perlfunc/last.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Label not found for "redo %s"</B>
<dd>
(F) You named a loop to restart, but you're not currently in a loop of
that name, not even if you count where you were called from.  See
perlfunc/last.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>listen() on closed fd</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to do a listen on a closed socket.  Did you forget to check
the return value of your socket() call?  See perlfunc/listen.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Literal @%s now requires backslash</B>
<dd>
(F) It used to be that Perl would try to guess whether you wanted an
array interpolated or a literal @.  It did this when the string was
first used at runtime.  Now strings are parsed at compile time, and
ambiguous instances of @ must be disambiguated, either by putting a
backslash to indicate a literal, or by declaring (or using) the array
within the program before the string (lexically).  (Someday it will simply
assume that an unbackslashed @ interpolates an array.)
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Method for operation %s not found in package %s during blessing</B>
<dd>
(F) An attempt was made to specify an entry in an overloading table that
doesn't somehow point to a valid method.  See 
<A HREF="perlovl.html">
the perlovl manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Might be a runaway multi-line %s string starting on line %d</B>
<dd>
(S) An advisory indicating that the previous error may have been caused
by a missing delimiter on a string or pattern, because it eventually
ended earlier on the current line.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Misplaced _ in number</B>
<dd>
(W) An underline in a decimal constant wasn't on a 3-digit boundary.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Missing $ on loop variable</B>
<dd>
(F) Apparently you've been programming in csh too much.  Variables are always
mentioned with the $ in Perl, unlike in the shells, where it can vary from 
one line to the next.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Missing comma after first argument to %s function</B>
<dd>
(F) While certain functions allow you to specify a filehandle or an
"indirect object" before the argument list, this ain't one of them.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Missing right bracket</B>
<dd>
(F) The lexer counted more opening curly brackets (braces) than closing ones.
As a general rule, you'll find it's missing near the place you were last
editing.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Missing semicolon on previous line?</B>
<dd>
(S) This is an educated guess made in conjunction with the message "%s
found where operator expected".  Don't automatically put a semicolon on
the previous line just because you saw this message.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Modification of a read-only value attempted</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried, directly or indirectly, to change the value of a
constant.  You didn't, of course, try "2 = 1", since the compiler
catches that.  But an easy way to do the same thing is:
<p></dd>
<pre>
        sub mod { $_[0] = 1 }
        mod(2);
</pre>
Another way is to assign to a substr() that's off the end of the string.
<p><dt><B>Modification of non-creatable array value attempted, subscript %d</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to make an array value spring into existence, and the
subscript was probably negative, even counting from end of the array
backwards.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Modification of non-creatable hash value attempted, subscript "%s"</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to make a hash value spring into existence, and it couldn't
be created for some peculiar reason.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Module name must be constant</B>
<dd>
(F) Only a bare module name is allowed as the first argument to a "use".
<p></dd>
<dt><B>msg%s not implemented</B>
<dd>
(F) You don't have System V message IPC on your system.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Multidimensional syntax %s not supported</B>
<dd>
(W) Multidimensional arrays aren't written like $foo[1,2,3].  They're written
like $foo[1][2][3], as in C.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Negative length</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv operation with a buffer length
that is less than 0.  This is difficult to imagine.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>nested *?+ in regexp</B>
<dd>
(F) You can't quantify a quantifier without intervening parens.  So
things like ** or +* or ?* are illegal.
<p></dd>
Note, however, that the minimal matching quantifiers, *?, +? and ?? appear
to be nested quantifiers, but aren't.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the perlre manpage</A>
.
<p><dt><B>No #! line</B>
<dd>
(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No %s allowed while running setuid</B>
<dd>
(F) Certain operations are deemed to be too insecure for a setuid or setgid
script to even be allowed to attempt.  Generally speaking there will be
another way to do what you want that is, if not secure, at least securable.
See 
<A HREF="perlsec.html">
the perlsec manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No  <A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_348">-e</A>  allowed in setuid scripts</B>
<dd>
(F) A setuid script can't be specified by the user.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No comma allowed after %s</B>
<dd>
(F) A list operator that has a filehandle or "indirect object" is not
allowed to have a comma between that and the following arguments.
Otherwise it'd be just another one of the arguments.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No DB::DB routine defined</B>
<dd>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_346">-d</A>
 switch,
but for some reason the perl5db.pl file (or some facsimile thereof)
didn't define a routine to be called at the beginning of each
statement.  Which is odd, because the file should have been required
automatically, and should have blown up the require if it didn't parse
right.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No dbm on this machine</B>
<dd>
(P) This is counted as an internal error, because every machine should
supply dbm nowadays, since Perl comes with SDBM.  See SDBM_File.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No DBsub routine</B>
<dd>
(F) The currently executing code was compiled with the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_346">-d</A>
 switch,
but for some reason the perl5db.pl file (or some facsimile thereof)
didn't define a DB::sub routine to be called at the beginning of each
ordinary subroutine call.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No Perl script found in input</B>
<dd>
(F) You called <B>perl -x</B>, but no line was found in the file beginning
with #! and containing the word "perl".
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No setregid available</B>
<dd>
(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setregid() call for
your system.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No setreuid available</B>
<dd>
(F) Configure didn't find anything resembling the setreuid() call for
your system.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No space allowed after  <A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_351">-I</A> </B>
<dd>
(F) The argument to 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_351">-I</A>
 must follow the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_351">-I</A>
 immediately with no
intervening space.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>No such signal: SIG%s</B>
<dd>
(W) You specified a signal name as a subscript to %SIG that was not recognized.
Say <B>kill -l</B> in your shell to see the valid signal names on your system.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not a CODE reference</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a
subroutine), but found a reference to something else instead.  You can
use the ref() function to find out what kind of ref it really was.
See also 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the perlref manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not a format reference</B>
<dd>
(F) I'm not sure how you managed to generate a reference to an anonymous
format, but this indicates you did, and that it didn't exist.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not a GLOB reference</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a "type glob" (that is,
a symbol table entry that looks like <B>*foo</B>), but found a reference to
something else instead.  You can use the ref() function to find out
what kind of ref it really was.  See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the perlref manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not a HASH reference</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a hash value, but
found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref()
function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the perlref manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not a perl script</B>
<dd>
(F) The setuid emulator requires that scripts have a well-formed #! line
even on machines that don't support the #! construct.  The line must
mention perl.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not a SCALAR reference</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a scalar value, but
found a reference to something else instead.  You can use the ref()
function to find out what kind of ref it really was.  See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the perlref manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not a subroutine reference</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl was trying to evaluate a reference to a code value (that is, a

<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not a subroutine reference in %OVERLOAD</B>

<A HREF="perlovl.html">
the perlovl manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not an ARRAY reference</B>

<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not enough arguments for %s</B>
<dd>
(F) The function requires more arguments than you specified.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Not enough format arguments</B>

See 
<A HREF="perlform.html">
the perlform manpage</A>

(F) You can't require the null filename, especially since on many machines
that means the current directory!  See perlfunc/require.

(W) You said something like
<p></dd>
<pre>
        my $foo, $bar = @_;
</pre>
when you meant
<p><pre>
        my ($foo, $bar) = @_;
</pre>
Remember that "my" and "local" bind closer than comma.
<p><dt><B>Perl %3.3f required--this is only version %s, stopped</B>
<dd>
(F) The module in question uses features of a version of Perl more recent
than the currently running version.  How long has it been since you upgraded,
anyway?  See perlfunc/require.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Permission denied</B>
<dd>
(F) The setuid emulator in suidperl decided you were up to no good.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>POSIX getpgrp can't take an argument</B>
<dd>
(F) Your C compiler uses POSIX getpgrp(), which takes no argument, unlike
the BSD version, which takes a pid.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Possible memory corruption: %s overflowed 3rd argument</B>
<dd>
(F) An ioctl() or fcntl() returned more than Perl was bargaining for.
Perl guesses a reasonable buffer size, but puts a sentinel byte at the
end of the buffer just in case.  This sentinel byte got clobbered, and
Perl assumes that memory is now corrupted.  See perlfunc/ioctl.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Precedence problem: open %s should be open(%s)</B>
<dd>
(S) The old irregular construct
    
    open FOO || die;
<p></dd>
is now misinterpreted as
<p><pre>
        open(FOO || die);
</pre>
because of the strict regularization of Perl 5's grammar into unary and
list operators.  (The old open was a little of both.) You must put
parens around the filehandle, or use the new "or" operator instead of "||".
<p>
<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_189">print on closed filehandle %s</A></b>
<dd>
(W) The filehandle you're printing on got itself closed sometime before now.
Check your logic flow.
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_190">printf on closed filehandle %s</A></b>
<dd>
(W) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime before now.
Check your logic flow.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Probable precedence problem on %s</B>
<dd>
(W) The compiler found a bare word where it expected a conditional,
which often indicates that an || or &amp;&amp; was parsed as part of the
last argument of the previous construct, for example:
<p></dd>
<pre>
        open FOO || die;
</pre>
<dt><B>Read on closed filehandle &lt;%s&gt;</B>
<dd>
(W) The filehandle you're reading from got itself closed sometime before now.
Check your logic flow.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Reallocation too large: %lx</B>

<dd>
(F) You can't use the 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_347">-D</A>
 option unless the code to produce the
desired output is compiled into Perl, which entails some overhead,
which is why it's currently left out of your copy.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Recursive inheritance detected</B>
<dd>
(F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were used.  Probably indicates
an unintended loop in your inheritance hierarchy.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Reference miscount in sv_replace()</B>
<dd>
(W) The internal sv_replace() function was handed a new SV with a
reference count of other than 1.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>regexp memory corruption</B>
<dd>
(P) The regular expression engine got confused by what the regular
expression compiler gave it.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>regexp out of space</B>
<dd>
(P) A "can't happen" error, because safemalloc() should have caught it earlier.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>regexp too big</B>
<dd>
(F) The current implementation of regular expression uses shorts as
address offsets within a string.  Unfortunately this means that if
the regular expression compiles to longer than 32767, it'll blow up.
Usually when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better
way to do it with multiple statements.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the perlre manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Reversed %s= operator</B>
<dd>
(W) You wrote your assignment operator backwards.  The = must always
comes last, to avoid ambiguity with subsequent unary operators.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Runaway format</B>
<dd>
(F) Your format contained the ~~ repeat-until-blank sequence, but it
produced 200 lines at once, and the 200th line looked exactly like the
199th line.  Apparently you didn't arrange for the arguments to exhaust
themselves, either by using ^ instead of @ (for scalar variables), or by
shifting or popping (for array variables).  See 
<A HREF="perlform.html">
the perlform manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Scalar value @%s[%s] better written as $%s[%s]</B>
<dd>
(W) You've used an array slice (indicated by @) to select a single value of
an array.  Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by $).
The difference is that $foo[&amp;bar] always behaves like a scalar, both when
assigning to it and when evaluating its argument, while @foo[&amp;bar] behaves
like a list when you assign to it, and provides a list context to its
subscript, which can do weird things if you're only expecting one subscript.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Script is not setuid/setgid in suidperl</B>
<dd>
(F) Oddly, the suidperl program was invoked on a script with its setuid
or setgid bit set.  This doesn't make much sense.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Search pattern not terminated</B>
<dd>
(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a // or m{}
construct.  Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>seek() on unopened file</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to use the seek() function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has been closed since.
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_216">select not implemented</A></b>

(F) This machine doesn't implement the select() system call.
<p></dd>

<dd>
(F) You don't have System V semaphore IPC on your system.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>semi-panic: attempt to dup freed string</B>
<dd>
(S) The internal newSVsv() routine was called to duplicate a scalar
that had previously been marked as free.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Semicolon seems to be missing</B>
<dd>
(W) A nearby syntax error was probably caused by a missing semicolon,
or possibly some other missing operator, such as a comma.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Send on closed socket</B>
<dd>
(W) The filehandle you're sending to got itself closed sometime before now.
Check your logic flow.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Sequence (?#... not terminated</B>
<dd>
(F) A regular expression comment must be terminated by a closing
parenthesis.  Embedded parens aren't allowed.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">

.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Sequence (?%s...) not implemented</B>

the setegid() system call (or equivalent), or at least Configure didn't
think so.

the seteuid() system call (or equivalent), or at least Configure didn't
think so.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>setrgid() not implemented</B>

(F) You tried to assign to $(, and your operating system doesn't support
the setrgid() system call (or equivalent), or at least Configure didn't
think so.

<dt><B>setruid() not implemented</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to assign to $&lt;, and your operating system doesn't support
the setruid() system call (or equivalent), or at least Configure didn't
think so.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Setuid/gid script is writable by world</B>
<dd>
(F) The setuid emulator won't run a script that is writable by the world,
because the world might have written on it already.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>shm%s not implemented</B>
<dd>
(F) You don't have System V shared memory IPC on your system.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>shutdown() on closed fd</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to do a shutdown on a closed socket.  Seems a bit superfluous.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>SIG%s handler "%s" not defined.</B>
<dd>
(W) The signal handler named in %SIG doesn't, in fact, exist.  Perhaps you
put it into the wrong package?
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_234">sort is now a reserved word</A></b>
<dd>
(F) An ancient error message that almost nobody ever runs into anymore.
But before sort was a keyword, people sometimes used it as a filehandle.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Sort subroutine didn't return a numeric value</B>
<dd>
(F) A sort comparison routine must return a number.  You probably blew
it by not using C<&lt;=&gt; or <B>cmp</B>, or by not using them correctly.
See perlfunc/sort.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Sort subroutine didn't return single value</B>
<dd>
(F) A sort comparison subroutine may not return a list value with more
or less than one element.  See perlfunc/sort.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Split loop</B>
<dd>
(P) The split was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a split shouldn't iterate
more times than there are characters of input, which is what happened.)
See perlfunc/split.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Stat on unopened file &lt;%s&gt;</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to use the stat() function (or an equivalent file test)
on a filehandle that was either never opened or has been closed since.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Statement unlikely to be reached</B>
<dd>
(W) You did an exec() with some statement after it other than a die().
This is almost always an error, because exec() never returns unless
there was a failure.  You probably wanted to use system() instead,
which does return.  To suppress this warning, put the exec() in a block
by itself.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Subroutine %s redefined</B>
<dd>
(W) You redefined a subroutine.  To suppress this warning, say
<p></dd>
<pre>
        {
        local $^W = 0;
        eval "sub name { ... }";
        }
</pre>
<dt><B>Substitution loop</B>
<dd>
(P) The substitution was looping infinitely.  (Obviously, a
substitution shouldn't iterate more times than there are characters of
input, which is what happened.) See the discussion of substitution in
perlop/"Quote and Quotelike Operators".
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Substitution pattern not terminated</B>
<dd>
(F) The lexer couldn't find the interior delimiter of a s/// or s{}{}
construct.  Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Substitution replacement not terminated</B>
<dd>
(F) The lexer couldn't find the final delimiter of a s/// or s{}{}
construct.  Remember that bracketing delimiters count nesting level.
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_242">substr outside of string</A></b>
<dd>
(W) You tried to reference a substr() that pointed outside of a string.
That is, the absolute value of the offset was larger than the length of
the string.  See perlfunc/substr.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>suidperl is no longer needed since...</B>
<dd>
(F) Your Perl was compiled with 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_347">-D</A>
SETUID_SCRIPTS_ARE_SECURE_NOW, but a
version of the setuid emulator somehow got run anyway.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>syntax error</B>
<dd>
(F) Probably means you had a syntax error.  Common reasons include:
<p></dd>
<pre>
        A keyword is misspelled.
        A semicolon is missing.
        A comma is missing.
        An opening or closing parenthesis is missing.
        An opening or closing brace is missing.
        A closing quote is missing.
</pre>
Often there will be another error message associated with the syntax
error giving more information.  (Sometimes it helps to turn on 
<A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_362">-w</A>
.)
The error message itself often tells you where it was in the line when
it decided to give up.  Sometimes the actual error is several tokens
before this, since Perl is good at understanding random input.
Occasionally the line number may be misleading, and once in a blue moon
the only way to figure out what's triggering the error is to call
<B>perl -c</B> repeatedly, chopping away half the program each time to see
if the error went away.  Sort of the cybernetic version of 20 questions.
<p><dt><B>System V IPC is not implemented on this machine</B>
<dd>
(F) You tried to do something with a function beginning with "sem", "shm"
or "msg".  See perlfunc/semctl, for example.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Syswrite on closed filehandle</B>
<dd>
(W) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime before now.
Check your logic flow.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>tell() on unopened file</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to use the tell() function on a filehandle that was either
never opened or has been closed since.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Test on unopened file &lt;%s&gt;</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to invoke a file test operator on a filehandle that isn't
open.  Check your logic.  See also perlfunc/-X.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>That use of $[ is unsupported</B>
<dd>
(F) Assignment to $[ is now strictly circumscribed, and interpreted as
a compiler directive.  You may only say one of
<p></dd>
<pre>
        $[ = 0;
        $[ = 1;
        ...
        local $[ = 0;
        local $[ = 1;
        ...
</pre>
This is to prevent the problem of one module changing the array base
out from under another module inadvertently.  See perlvar/$[.
<p><dt><B>The %s function is unimplemented</B>
<dd>
The function indicated isn't implemented on this architecture, according
to the probings of Configure.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>The crypt() function is unimplemented due to excessive paranoia.</B>
<dd>
(F) Configure couldn't find the crypt() function on your machine,
probably because your vendor didn't supply it, probably because they
think the U.S. Govermnment thinks it's a secret, or at least that they
will continue to pretend that it is.  And if you quote me on that, I
will deny it.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>The stat preceding <B>-l _</B> wasn't an lstat</B>
<dd>
(F) It makes no sense to test the current stat buffer for symbolic linkhood
if the last stat that wrote to the stat buffer already went past
the symlink to get to the real file.  Use an actual filename instead.
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_252">times not implemented</A></b>
<dd>
(F) Your version of the C library apparently doesn't do times().  I suspect
you're not running on Unix.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Too few args to syscall</B>
<dd>
(F) There has to be at least one argument to syscall() to specify the
system call to call, silly dilly.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Too many args to syscall</B>
<dd>
(F) Perl only supports a maximum of 14 args to syscall().
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Too many arguments for %s</B>
<dd>
(F) The function requires fewer arguments than you specified.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>trailing \ in regexp</B>
<dd>
(F) The regular expression ends with an unbackslashed backslash.  Backslash
it.   See

construct.
<p></dd>

<dt><b><A NAME="perlfunc_254">truncate not implemented</A></b>
<dd>
(F) Your machine doesn't implement a file truncation mechanism that
Configure knows about.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Type of arg %d to %s must be %s (not %s)</B>
<dd>
(F) This function requires the argument in that position to be of a
certain type.  Arrays must be @NAME or @{EXPR}.  Hashes must be
%NAME or %{EXPR}.  No implicit dereferencing is allowed--use the
{EXPR} forms as an explicit dereference.  See 
<A HREF="perlref.html">
the perlref manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>umask: argument is missing initial 0</B>
<dd>
(W) A umask of 222 is incorrect.  It should be 0222, since octal literals
always start with 0 in Perl, as in C.

<p></dd>
<dt><B>Undefined subroutine called</B>
<dd>
(F) The anonymous subroutine you're trying to call hasn't been defined,
or if it was, it has since been undefined.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Undefined subroutine in sort</B>
<dd>
(F) The sort comparison routine specified is declared but doesn't seem to
have been defined yet.  See perlfunc/sort.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>unexec of %s into %s failed!</B>
<dd>
(F) The unexec() routine failed for some reason.  See your local FSF
representative, who probably put it there in the first place.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unknown BYTEORDER</B>
<dd>
(F) There are no byteswapping functions for a machine with this byte order.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>unmatched () in regexp</B>
<dd>
(F) Unbackslashed parentheses must always be balanced in regular
expressions.  If you're a vi user, the % key is valuable for finding
the matching paren.  See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the perlre manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unmatched right bracket</B>
<dd>
(F) The lexer counted more closing curly brackets (braces) than opening
ones, so you're probably missing an opening bracket.  As a general
rule, you'll find the missing one (so to speak) near the place you were
last editing.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>unmatched [] in regexp</B>
<dd>
(F) The brackets around a character class must match.  If you wish to
include a closing bracket in a character class, backslash it or put it first.
See 
<A HREF="perlre.html">
the perlre manpage</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unquoted string "%s" may clash with future reserved word</B>
<dd>
(W) You used a bare word that might someday be claimed as a reserved word.
It's best to put such a word in quotes, or capitalize it somehow, or insert
an underbar into it.  You might also declare it as a subroutine.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unrecognized character \%03o ignored</B>
<dd>
(S) A garbage character was found in the input, and ignored, in case it's
a weird control character on an EBCDIC machine, or some such.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unrecognized signal name "%s"</B>
<dd>
(F) You specified a signal name to the kill() function that was not recognized.
Say <B>kill -l</B> in your shell to see the valid signal names on your system.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unrecognized switch: -%s</B>
<dd>
(F) You specified an illegal option to Perl.  Don't do that.
(If you think you didn't do that, check the #! line to see if it's
supplying the bad switch on your behalf.)
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unsuccessful %s on filename containing newline</B>
<dd>
(W) A file operation was attempted on a filename, and that operation
failed, PROBABLY because the filename contained a newline, PROBABLY
because you forgot to chop() or chomp() it off.  See perlfunc/chop.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unsupported directory function "%s" called</B>
<dd>
(F) Your machine doesn't support opendir() and readdir().
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unsupported function %s</B>
<dd>
(F) This machines doesn't implement the indicated function, apparently.
At least, Configure doesn't think so.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unsupported socket function "%s" called</B>
<dd>
(F) Your machine doesn't support the Berkeley socket mechanism, or at
least that's what Configure thought.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Unterminated &lt;&gt; operator</B>
<dd>
(F) The lexer saw a left angle bracket in a place where it was expecting
a term, so it's looking for the corresponding right angle bracket, and not
finding it.  Chances are you left some needed parentheses out earlier in
the line, and you really meant a "less than".
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Use of $# is deprecated</B>
<dd>
(D) This was an ill-advised attempt to emulate a poorly defined awk feature.
Use an explicit printf() or sprintf() instead.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Use of $* is deprecated</B>
<dd>
(D) This variable magically turned on multiline pattern matching, both for
you and for any luckless subroutine that you happen to call.  You should
use the new <B>//m</B> and <B>//s</B> modifiers now to do that without the dangerous
action-at-a-distance effects of 
<A HREF="perlvar.html#perlvar_382">$*</A>
.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Use of %s is deprecated</B>
<dd>
(D) The construct indicated is no longer recommended for use, generally
because there's a better way to do it, and also because the old way has
bad side effects.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Use of implicit split to @_ is deprecated</B>
<dd>
(D) It makes a lot of work for the compiler when you clobber a
subroutine's argument list, so it's better if you assign the results of
a split() explicitly to an array (or list).
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Use of uninitialized value</B>
<dd>
(W) An undefined value was used as if it were already defined.  It was
interpreted as a "" or a 0, but maybe it was a mistake.  To suppress this
warning assign an initial value to your variables.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Useless use of %s in void context</B>
<dd>
(W) You did something without a side effect in a context that does nothing
with the return value, such as a statement that doesn't return a value
from a block, or the left side of a scalar comma operator.  Very often
this points not to stupidity on your part, but a failure of Perl to parse
your program the way you thought it would.  For example, you'd get this
if you mixed up your C precedence with Python precedence and said
<p></dd>
<pre>
        $one, $two = 1, 2;
</pre>
when you meant to say
<p><pre>
        ($one, $two) = (1, 2);
</pre>
<dt><B>Warning: unable to close filehandle %s properly.</B>
<dd>
(S) The implicit close() done by an open() got an error indication on the 
close(0.  This usually indicates your filesystem ran out of disk space.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Warning: Use of "%s" without parens is ambiguous</B>
<dd>
(S) You wrote a unary operator followed by something that looks like a
binary operator that could also have been interpreted as a term or
unary operator.  For instance, if you know that the rand function
has a default argument of 1.0, and you write
<p></dd>
<pre>
        rand + 5;
</pre>
you may THINK you wrote the same thing as
<p><pre>
        rand() + 5;
</pre>
but in actual fact, you got
<p><pre>
        rand(+5);
</pre>
So put in parens to say what you really mean.
<p><dt><B>Write on closed filehandle</B>
<dd>
(W) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime before now.
Check your logic flow.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>X outside of string</B>
<dd>
(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position before
the beginning of the string being unpacked.  See perlfunc/pack.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>x outside of string</B>
<dd>
(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after
the end of the string being unpacked.  See perlfunc/pack.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Xsub "%s" called in sort</B>
<dd>
(F) The use of an external subroutine as a sort comparison is not yet supported.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>Xsub called in sort</B>
<dd>
(F) The use of an external subroutine as a sort comparison is not yet supported.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>You can't use  <A HREF="perlrun.html#perlrun_352">-l</A>  on a filehandle</B>
<dd>
(F) A filehandle represents an opened file, and when you opened the file it
already went past any symlink you are presumably trying to look for.
Use a filename instead.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</B>
<dd>
(F) And you probably never will, since you probably don't have the
sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip
about what you want.  Your best bet is to use the wrapsuid script in
the eg directory to put a setuid C wrapper around your script.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>You need to quote "%s"</B>
<dd>
(W) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.  Unfortunately, you
already have a subroutine of that name declared, which means that Perl 5
will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is executed, which is
probably not what you want.  (If it IS what you want, put an &amp; in front.)
<p></dd>
<dt><B>[gs]etsockopt() on closed fd</B>
<dd>
(W) You tried to get or set a socket option on a closed socket.
Did you forget to check the return value of your socket() call?
See perlfunc/getsockopt.
<p></dd>
<dt><B>\1 better written as $1</B>
<dd>
(W) Outside of patterns, backreferences live on as variables.  The use
of backslashes is grandfathered on the righthand side of a
substitution, but stylistically it's better to use the variable form
because other Perl programmers will expect it, and it works better
if there are more than 9 backreferences.
