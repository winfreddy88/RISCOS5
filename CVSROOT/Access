# Access Control List file.  Controls who may commit to what branches
# and in what directories.  Comments start with #, blank links are legal
# Other lines are of the form (extra white space not allowed):
#
#    (a)  <branch>[(<dir>)][,<branch>...]:<user>,<user>...
# or (b)  @Group:<user>,<user>...
#
# (a) All users mentioned on the right can use any branch tag on the left
# within the directory (if specified, defaults to all directories).
# If the first user on the line is a hyphen ("-"), the effect of any
# earlier line for each tag is cancelled within the specified directory.
# This could be used to lock out a section of the directory structure
# from commits.
#
# (b) Creates a group of users, which can be referred to in the user field.
# For example, the line "@ALL:*" would create a group called @ALL containing
# all users.  The line "TRUNK(Test):@ALL" would then allow everyone to commit
# to the TRUNK for directory Test.
