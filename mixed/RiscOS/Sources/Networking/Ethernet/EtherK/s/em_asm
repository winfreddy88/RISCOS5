;   This veneer is attached using OS_ClaimDeviceVector with the workspace
;   pointer set to point to the relevant struct device. It puts the device
;   structure pointer in R1, retrieves the module workspace pointer from the
;   first word in the device structure and puts it in R12, then jumps to the
;   standard CMHG vector handler veneer.
