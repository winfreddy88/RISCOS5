Note that this component is currently under the "mixed" hierarchy because it
contains a mixture of BSD and shared-source licenced code - but the vast
majority is BSD. If you are doing any work on this HAL, please ask before
creating or importing any shared-source code here. There is a possibility
that this HAL may be used by NetBSD, and we need to keep the code BSD
licenced for it to be of use to them.
