; A couple of utility functions for reading/writing registers from the TWL4030/TPS65950 IC
; (although the protocol is probably generic enough to work with many other IIC devices)

; For the majority of uses, v1 simply needs to be initialised as follows:
; LDR  v1, OSentries+4*OS_IICOpV
; i.e. the IIC transfer will be performed on IIC bus 0, via RISCOS_IICOpV. This means that 0
; will be returned on success, or an OS error block pointer on failure!
; When using OS_IICOpV, v2 can be left uninitialised.
