 * Completely reworked to make it closer to the UNIX original, i.e. check
 * both read and write access in one call by OR'ing the appropriate mode
 * bits.  This call is still pretty naff, because RISC OS has no concept
 * of users, therefore when used on NFS filesystems this call has to
 * assume that it is the owner access bits that need to be checked rather
 * than the public ones.
