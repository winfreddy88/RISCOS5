Hinfo?/Hinfo??:This \w displays information about ChangeFSI.
Hpic?/Hpic??:\Toutput image from ChangeFSI.
Hsave0:Drag this icon to the directory in which you want to save the file, or drag it to the program into which you want to transfer the data.
Hsave1:This shows the filename for this data. If it is not a full pathname, drag the icon into a directory display.
Hsave2:\Ssave the data with the current filename. If it is not a full pathname, you must drag the icon to a directory first.
Hsave?/Hsave??:This \w allows you to save data in a file, or transfer it to another application.
Hsprite?/Hsprite??:This \w displays information on the output image produced.
Hjpeg1:\Screate colour JPEGs.
Hjpeg2:\Screate greyscale JPEGs.
Hjpeg5:Enter a quality directly in this box.|MValues in the range 0-100 are accepted and trade off file size with image quality.|MA value of 100 means 'do not compress'.|M
Hjpeg3:\Sdecrease the quality (smaller output file).
Hjpeg4:\Sincrease the quality (larger output file).
Hjpeg?/Hjpeg??:This \w sets the output JPEG type.
Hzoom?/Hzoom??:Either fill in the numerator and denominator, or click \s on the arrows, to use the given zoom factor.
Hrange?/Hrange??:This \w displays the range of pixel intensities used.
Hsrc?/Hsrc??:This \w displays information on the source image that was processed.
Hscale0:\Sdisable automatic pixel size correction for source pixels only.
Hscale18:\Sdisable all automatic pixel size correction.
Hscale19:\Sattempt to scale the image as requested but overall retain the picture aspect ratio. 
Hscale1:\Sscale to fill the current screen size.
Hscale2:\Sperform no scaling.
Hscale3:\Shalve the height.
Hscale4:\Shalve the width.
Hscale5:\Shalve both the width and height.
Hscale9:\Suse a custom scaling factor.
Hscale10/Hscale12:The numerator is an initial scaling up of the source image.
Hscale11/Hscale13:The denominator is a subsequent scaling down of the source image.
Hscale6:\Senable rotation.
Hscale16:\Srotate clockwise 90 degrees.
Hscale17:\Srotate anti-clockwise 90 degrees.
Hscale7:\Sflip the image about its vertical edge.
Hscale8:\Sflip the image about its horizontal edge.
Hscale?/Hscale??:This \w sets up geometrical operations to perform on the source image.
Hproc0:\Sanalyse the source image and attempt to maximise the dynamic range used in the output.
Hproc1:\Sanalyse the source image and attempt to spread the intensities evenly in the output.
Hproc2:\Sturn off the error diffusion patterns used to trick the eye when not enough colours are available.
Hproc3:\Smake a negative.
Hproc4:\Sslightly lighten the output image.
Hproc5:\Sattempt to correct for black inked spots bigger than the given size.
Hproc6:\Sapply gamma correction for the display.
Hproc7:\Sdigitally sharpen the source image.
Hproc12:\Sdigitally soften the source image.
Hproc8:Enter a number in the range 0-128.|M0 means no correction, 128 is severe correction.
Hproc9:Enter a number for gamma.|MMonitors typically use a gamma factor of 2.2.
Hproc10:Enter a number in the range 8-31.|M8 means most sharp, 31 is slight sharpening.
Hproc11:Enter a number in the range 1 to 23.|M1 means most soft, 23 is slight softening.
Hproc?/Hproc??:This \w sets up special effects to perform on the source image.
