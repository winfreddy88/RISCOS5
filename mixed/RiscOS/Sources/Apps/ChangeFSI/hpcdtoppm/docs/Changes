Changes of hpcdtoppm:

v0.6:

- hpcdtoppm now finds the 64Base extension files from the
  path given for the image-file name. 

- small bug fixed.

v0.6 beta patch2:

- bug fixed for images with more than one file for
  each 64base plane

v0.6 beta patch1:

- bug fixed in opening the 64Base files.

- a debugging printf removed.

v0.6 beta:

- Code added to read 64Base


v0.5 pl1:

- Bug fixed in main.c, procedure f_ov. When writing all the
  images from overview files, a lot of file descriptors were
  opened, but never closed. This produced write errors if the
  machine has not enough file descriptors.

- procedure clear renamed to clearimpl to avoid collision with
  other libraries

- data types OUTGRAY and OUTRGB renamed to OUT1PL and OUT3PL,
  these data types are not bound to special color models.

- gsave/grestore added to postscript output

v0.5:

- Bug fixed in pgm writing procedure

- Missing ':' added in BoundingBox line of encapsulated
  Postscript

- postscript output with Floyd-Steinberg dithering added

- orientation chooser for contact sheet option -C

- accepts input from stdin (give '-' as filename)

- -S option for subrectangles

- procedure definitions in ANSI-C

- "turn on head" added.


v0.4:

- Additional Options -m, -pos, -rep, -crop

- pgm output added

- postscript output added

- Flip options

- color corrections

- primitive form of contact sheet

- simple method of jumping over reading errors in
  Huffman code

- optional Huffman-Lookuptable for speedup



v0.3:
- Additional Options -x, -a and -ycc

- bcopy thrown out.

- New datatype sBYTE for char. This fixes the problem with
  compilers which have the char unsigned. These got some
  'snow' in their pictures (merry christmas :-).

- Address arithmetik bug fixed in writepicture

v0.2:

- Small workaround for strange behavior of address-calculation
  of a c-compiler for NeXT.

- Improved rounding for integer maths.

  want to use pbmplus-routines or the included routines.
