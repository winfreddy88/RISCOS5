                       !Connector
                       ==========

Connector is a terminal emulator supporting the XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM and
plain ASCII protocols which can be used to exchange information with other
computers either locally with a DTE-DTE serial cable, or remotely via a modem.


Features
--------

  * VT102 + ANSI +  AVATAR + CEPT terminal emulation.
  * XModem, YModem, ZModem, ASCII file transfer Protocols.
  * Fast display drivers with its own font.
  * Supports Block Drivers.
  * AutoLogon.
  * Spool Function.
  * Script language.


Configuration
-------------
Several different configurations can exist in the Config directory
of Connector's choices. By default it uses the settings held in 'config'
but alternative settings can be specified with the -config switch when
running Connector.

The title bar of the 'Connector configuration' dialogue shows which
settings are the ones being modified, therefore it will say '(config)'
by default.


Modem
-----
The modem init string will be send to the modem optinal on startup
or if you select "Init modem" on the main menu.
The dial prefix string + number + dial suffix string will be send
to the modem while dialling a number.
For hangup it's possible to send the hangup string or to drop
DTR for one second.(this works only if you modem is
configured to do this)

"|W" waits one second
"|M" return


Terminal
--------
The insert/delete option for chat works only if both sides are using
Connector.


Serial Port
-----------
If you use a PC cable you should use the "InternalPC" driver, otherwise
the "Internal" driver.


Filetransfer
------------
Filetype conversion
  syntax:extension of the filename space filetype number
  gif 695,pcx 697 ...

If you turn on the "Save terminal status" option the actual status
of terminaltype,baud rate,data,filetransfer type,spool speed,wrap mode,
local echo,cr==>cr/lf,lf==>cr/lf,25 lines will be also saved.


Toolbar
-------
File transfer Icon

  select button : sending files
  menu button   : opens the downloads directory
  adjust button : receiving files
                  (with Zmodem the receive starts automaticly)

Telephone Book Icon

  select button : opens the Telephone Book Directory.
  menu button   : opens a fast dial menu.

Hangup Icon

  select button : hangs up the modem, using the handshaking lines

Dial Icon

  select button : picks up the modem, and sends the dialling sequence


Bottom Window
-------------
Displays the current modem status.
Terminaltype,baud,data,filetransfer(can be altered),online time,
modem status,status line for autologon.
Pressing the button on the left opens a serial information window.


Main window
-----------
The select-button grabs text in the mousebuffer.
The adjust-button pastes the text out of the mousebuffer at the cursor
position.
Double click selects a word.
Trible click selects a line.

dragging an text-file in the main window pastes the text at
the cursor position.
dragging an data-file (with shift dragg all filetypes) in the main 
window opens the spool window.


Telephone Book
--------------
Double clicking on an entry starts the connection.


Script Files
------------
The syntax looks like this:

REM Remark
NAME     "what ever"    ;
NUMBER   "1234564"      ; Telephone number
TERMINAL VT102          ; VT102,ANSI,CHAT
BAUD     19200
DATA     8N1
FILETR   ZModem <TX window size> <send crashrecovery> <ACK intervall> 
                <receive crashrecovery|overwrite|rename>
         XModem <CRC|Checksum> <128 bytes|1024 bytes>
WRAP     ON             ; ON,OFF
ECHO     ON             ; ON,OFF
25LINES  OFF            ; ON,OFF
AVATAR   ON             ; turns ON/OFF the avatar emulation (only ANSI).
ONLINE   120            ; max. online time(in minutes) default is
                        ; 0 = unlimited
MODEMINIT ""            ; Init string for Modem
DOWNLOAD  ""            ; own download directory
ENDHEADER

REM After "ENDHEADER" only SEND,WAIT,DIAL,REM, IF, IFN, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN, 
REM SET, INC, DEC, HANGUP, QUIT, WAITUNTIL can follow.

WAITUNTIL 13.08.1997 11:59:40 ; waits until ....
DIAL                          ; dials number
WAIT 50                       ; waits 50 centiseconds
WAIT "Login"                  ; waits for String
SEND "topdog|M"               ; sends String
WAIT "Password",600           ; waits for String but only 6 seconds
SEND "xxxxxx|M"               ;

REM This is just a demo ...

loop:
SET counter 10
GOSUB do_this  
DEC counter
IF counter > 0 GOTO loop

IFN WAIT "test",400 GOTO something_different
SEND "Ok."
GOTO the_end
something_different:
SEND "Not ok."

the_end:

END

do_this:
SEND "blub"
RETURN

The script commands are NOT case sensitive, but the variables and labels 
are case sensitive.                             

If you choose "New" in the telephone book window you get a window to enter 
all these things, if you press save it generates this scriptfile so you don't
need to know the syntax.

If you choose "Logon" it opens the scriptfile in an text editor,
where you can edit the part under the DIAL command to autologon in a BBS.
