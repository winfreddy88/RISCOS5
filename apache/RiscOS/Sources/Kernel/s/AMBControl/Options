;performance enhancements originally introduced for Ursula OS

; ChocolateAMB       - if {FALSE}, disables all AMBControl crazy chocolate flavour enhancements
;
; AMB_LazyMapIn      - if {TRUE}, individual pages of a swapped-in task are only mapped in when
;                      necessary (happens via abort mechanism). This typically makes the swapping
;                      cost much lower and much less sensitive to large slot size. The worst case
;                      swapping cost is still good (abort mechanism cost is very small).
;                      Probably only worth supporting this on ARMs with simple instruction restart
;                      after abort (originally StrongARM revT or later for Ursula)
;
; AMB_ChocTrace      - if {TRUE}, keep trace info for some enhanced code calls and data (probably development only)
