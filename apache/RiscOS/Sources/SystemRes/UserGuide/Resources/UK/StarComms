                           Star command summaries
                           ======================


Introduction
============

This is an alphabetical list of every * Command available under RISC OS 5.24.

It is organised into sections:
* The star commands    - main listing
* Star command aliases - extra shorthand ways to issue selected commands
* Configure keywords   - options for *Configure and *Status commands

Each command is followed by a short explanation of its function and its
command syntax. This is not intended as a complete explanation of the
command, but as a quick reference for experienced users who may prefer to
use the command line. All of these commands are explained in greater detail
in the RISC OS Programmer's Reference Manual.

Exceptions:
* There may be additional commands, not listed here, that are provided by
  modules loaded when you run an application from disc. Consult the help
  provided with the application for more details.
* There may be additional commands, not listed here, that are provided by
  expansion cards or by extra software you have installed. Consult the
  documentation provided by the supplier of the add-on.
* Commands which are intended for use by RISC OS for its internal operation
  are not listed here. Do not use these commands in your programs.


Command syntax
==============

The syntax of each command is described in a standard way. The symbols
used in syntax descriptions are:

<value>         indicates that an actual value must be substituted. For
                example, <filename> means that an actual filename must be
                supplied.

[...]           indicates that the item enclosed in the square brackets is
                optional.

|               indicates alternatives. For example, 0 | 1 means that the
                value 0 or 1 must be supplied.
