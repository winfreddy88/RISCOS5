    GetClip
===========================================================================

GetClip is a simple application to test Clipboard_Get. It will accept data
of types Draw, JPEG and Text. If the clipboard owner can't provide the data
in any of these formats it should send the data in its native format [1].
In this case GetClip will display the message "Filetype not supported".

If the Clipboard module sends a Message_Paste with bit 0 set then GetClip
will display the message "No clipboard data". This will happen when the
Clipboard module is unable to obtain the clipboard data for some reason,
eg there's no task owning the clipboard, or data transfer is aborted.

[1] Not all applications do this. For example PrivatEye and OvationPro do
not respond to Message_DataRequest if they cannot supply the clipboard
data in a format suitable for the receiver.


By using different tasks as clipboard owner various aspects of the Clipboard
module can be tested.

 - Using the supplied PutClip application will test if the clipboard data
   has been transfered correctly using Clipboard_Put.

 - Using the supplied Put application will test if the clipboard data
   has been transfered correctly using Clipboard_Put.

 - Using the supplied PutProxy will test obtaining the clipboard data
   via Message_Put & Clipboard_Put.

 - Using StrongED will test obtaining the clipboard data using the
   RAMTransfer protocol.

 - Using NetSurf will test obtaining the clipboard data using the
   FileTransfer protocol.
