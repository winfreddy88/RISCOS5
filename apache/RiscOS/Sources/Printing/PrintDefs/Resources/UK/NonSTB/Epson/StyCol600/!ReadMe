Espon Stylus 600 (1440dpi) driver 
---------------------------------

This driver is designed for use with !Printers 1.53 or later. It
consists of the printer definition file StyCol600 along with a
Palettes directory, with three printer palette files.

To install in !Printers other than 1.54 (disc based):

 - Open the !Printers directory, by holding down a shift key
   and double-clicking on the !Printers icon in the disc
   viewer. (You will need to find where !Printers is installed
   on your disc.)

 - Copy the Palettes directory supplied with this release into
   the !Printers directory you have just opened. This updates
   the set of Palettes.

 - Install the definition file as normal, and save choices
   as desired. To make absolutely sure the newer palette files
   are used, you should reboot your machine.


To install in !Printers 1.54 (ROM based):

 - Open the !Boot directory, by holding down a shift key
   and double-clicking on the !Boot icon in the disc viewer.
   Open the Choices directory in !Boot, then the Printers
   directory in Choices.

 - Copy the Palettes directory supplied with this release into
   the Printers directory you have just opened. (It doesn't
   matter whether there is currently a Palettes directory there
   or not). This updates the set of palettes available to the
   ROM based !Printers.

 - Install the definition file as normal, and save choices
   as desired. To make absolutely sure the newer palette files
   are used, you should reboot your machine.
