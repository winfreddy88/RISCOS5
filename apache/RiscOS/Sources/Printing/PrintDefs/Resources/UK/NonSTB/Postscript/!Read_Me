Read_Me file for Postscript printers.
-------------------------------------

These printer definition files enable the use of those
printers which understand the Postscript page description
language.

They define a colour PostScript printer with a
resolution of 300 by 300 dpi, with the standard 35
fonts that Adobe provides.

There are two language levels supported, Level 1 and Level 2.
The choice of PDF file will determine which mode the printer
drivers are switched to, other than that they are the same.

For computers which support a fast parallel connection you
should select the PDF with an "F" at the end of the filename
which will switch the fast parallel interface 'on'.
