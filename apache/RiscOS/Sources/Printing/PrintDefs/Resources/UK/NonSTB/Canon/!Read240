Read_Me file for Canon BJC-240
------------------------------
The Canon BJC-240 is factory set to default to BJ emulation. You
need to set LQ emulation before using the 240 with !Printers. This
need only be done once. Refer to the printer user guide, or follow
these instructions:

  - make sure the printer is turned off for at least 15 seconds

  - press and hold the power button, and listen for printer beeps

  - wait for eight beeps, then release the power button

This sets European LQ mode, which is remembered until the set-up
is changed again. The printer is now ready to use with !Printers.


This PDF is for use with the Canon BJC-240. It is only an interim release.
The palettes have not been accurately defined, so you may find that colour
matching is not very accurate. In this release, there is no support for the
photorealistic or fluorescent cartridges.
