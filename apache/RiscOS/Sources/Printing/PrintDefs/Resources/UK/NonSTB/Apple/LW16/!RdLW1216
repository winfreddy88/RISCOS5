These printer definition files are for use with the Apple LaserWriter 12/640
and 16/600 printers. The 12/640 supports duplex printing and different feeds.
The 16/600 does not support duplex printing, but does support different
feeds.

The feed options on the LaserWriter 12/640 are as follows:

Single sided, upper cassette
        The 250-sheet cassette

Single sided, lower cassette
        The optional 500-sheet cassette
        
Single sided, multipurpose tray
        The fold down 80-sheet tray when in general use
        
Single sided, envelope/postcard
        The fold down 80-sheet tray when used for envelopes/postcards
        
Double sided, upper cassette
        The 250-sheet cassette with the tops aligned (best for portrait
        binding)

Upper first sheet then lower
        The first page is from the 250-sheet cassette. All subsequent sheets

        first page only on headed paper

        The 250-sheet cassette with the tops at opposite ends (best for
        landscape binding)
