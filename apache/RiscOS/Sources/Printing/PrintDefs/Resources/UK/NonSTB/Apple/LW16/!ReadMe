These printer definition files are for use with the Apple LaserWriter 12/640
and 16/600 printers. The 12/640 supports duplex printing and different feeds.
The 16/600 and 12/660 do not support duplex printing, but do support
different feeds.

It is necessary to update printers in order to use these PDFs. If you have
a disc based version of !Printers (anything other than v1.54) then drop the
!Printers supplied onto your existing version. If you have !Printers v1.54
(which is in ROM), then drop the !Boot supplied onto your existing version.

DO NOT DELETE YOUR EXISTING VERSIONS OF !BOOT OR !PRINTERS

The feed options on the LaserWriter 12/640 are as follows:

        The 250-sheet cassette

Single sided, lower cassette
        The optional 500-sheet cassette
        
Single sided, multipurpose tray
        The fold down 80-sheet tray when in general use
        
Single sided, envelope/postcard
        The fold down 80-sheet tray when used for envelopes/postcards

        binding)

        The 250-sheet cassette with the tops at opposite ends (best for
        landscape binding)
