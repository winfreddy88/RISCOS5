Epson EPL-5500
==============

This PDF is designed for use with the Epson EPL-5500. It will not work with
the EPL-5500W which is a GDI printer designed for use with Microsoft Windows
only.

The EPL-5500 is shipped with 1MB of memory as standard. This is suitable for
full A4 printing at 300 dpi resolution. It is NOT sufficient for full A4
printing at 600dpi. If you attempt to print at 600dpi, the error light will
flash slowly. Pressing the control button on the printer will clear the error
and the page will print. Sections of the page will be fuzzy or at a lower
resolution than 600dpi. If printing at 600dpi is important to you, then
the printer should have a memory upgrade.
