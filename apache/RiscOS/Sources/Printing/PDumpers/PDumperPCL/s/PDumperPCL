; Changes I made:
; 1. In StartJob set a flag that Job has been started
; 2. In StartPage
;    If flag that job has started then
;    - reset flag that job has started
;    - initialise printer
;    - set duplex based on PDF entry in data10:
;      N = none, S = short binding, L = long binding, R = rotating pages
;      (rotating pages since some printers like Canon iSensys MF4690PL does
;       not do long binding duplex otherwise...)
;    If rotating pages then
;    - send Esc & l 0 O on odd  pages (i.e. do not rotate)
;    - send Esc & l 2 O on even pages (i.e. rotate)
; 3. In EndPage do not send printer reset ('Esc E Esc %-12345X')
