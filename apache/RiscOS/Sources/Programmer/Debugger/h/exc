/* To avoid dynamic memory allocation we use a line buffer to collect annotations before they are output
   The buffer acts as a sliding window, storing the annotations for a contiguous range of memory
   The buffer is flushed in a lazy manner; we only emit entries once we need to add an annotation for an address which is outside the current window
   This allows us to go back and add annotations up to LINEBUFFER_SIZE lines in the past (required for e.g. STM decoding) */
