                           ARM BASIC Editor
                           ----------------


The ArmBE module is the very ancient (1987) vintage editor for BBC BASIC.

I have converted the module to be 32 bit neutral and have removed its use
of CMOS memory. The 8 bytes are now saved in the choices directory.

The 8 bytes of CMOS were &95-&98 (now DNSIPaddrCMOS)
                     and &B5-&B8 (now PoduleFrugalCMOS for podules 4 to 8)

I have not added any additional functionality so the editor will not be
aware of any changes to BBC BASIC in the intervening 17 years.
