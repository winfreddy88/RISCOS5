revision 1.1.2.9
date: 2003/01/30 22:53:34;  author: justin;  state: Exp;  lines: +11 -11
Summary:
  Added version number to the !Help file.
  Updated wording of parts of the !Help file.
  Fix for pane failing to resize horizontally when window resized.
Detail:
  * In order to make checking version numbers simpler, the version number
    is included on the first line of the !Help file.
  * The wording of the !Help file has been updated to take account of the
    change in ownership of the database and remove postal submissions. All
    references to Acorn should now have been removed, except where they
    refer to past-tense.
  * A 'Confidentiality' section has been added to the end of the document
    to provide some details of the confidential nature of the submissions.
    This is required as the application is no longer a developer only
    component, which means that it is no longer covered by the
    confidentiality agreement which the developer scheme was run under.
    This should clarify the position.
  * When resized horizontally, the pane would fail to resize and would
    therefore overlap the parent window. Rather than implement the
    pane as a nested window (which would require zero handling from the
    application), we handle this ourselves. This ensures that the
    application runs on the greatest selection of systems.
Admin:
  Tested locally and seems ok; the !Help file reads correctly and the
  window resizes as expected. Need to check with Alan that the state
  of the Confidentiality section is in line with his intention.

revision 1.1.2.6
date: 2003/01/28 17:06:36;  author: justin;  state: Exp;  lines: +7 -7
Summary:
  Added support for storing details in Choices.
Detail:
  * If possible, we try to read our configuration from Choices now, rather
    than just looking in the application. If no Choices is present, or we
    cannot write to it we use the application directory.
Admin:
  Tested locally.

revision 1.1.2.5
date: 2003/01/28 16:42:26;  author: justin;  state: Exp;  lines: +7 -7
Summary:
  Fix for deleting one of only two icons removing all elements.
Detail:
  * When you deleted one of two items in a window, all the elements would
    be cleared, resulting in losing the other item. This was due to an
    incorrect comparison between the number of elements and 1. We now
    compare to 0.
Admin:
  Tested locally with known failure case and now works.

Summary:

Detail:
  * We now use C routines to generate dates rather than calling a module.
Admin:
  Tested locally and seems to generate correct dates.

revision 1.1.2.3
date: 2003/01/28 16:15:59;  author: justin;  state: Exp;  lines: +7 -7
Summary:
  Updated to use modern style build.
  Added 'descriptions' when saving for emails.
Detail:
  * Email saving of the request results now describes the fields in the
    request in the text section of the messages.
Admin:
  Tested locally and seems to work.
  Note: We don't have DateUtils checked in because that module isn't
        supplied in source form.

date: 2003/01/28 16:02:29;  author: justin;  state: Exp;  lines: +1 -1
Summary:
  Initial import of the original Allocate application.
Detail:
  * Allocate is used for allocations of resources used by RISC OS.
Admin:
  Not tested; this is purely a check-point checkin so that I've got some
  reference to the original.
