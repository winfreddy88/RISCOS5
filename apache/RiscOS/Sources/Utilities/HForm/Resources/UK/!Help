                     !HForm 
                     ======

The !HForm application is used to prepare blank media for use
with RISC OS in its native FileCore format for use with ADFS,
SCSIFS, or memory cards via SDFS.

Read the appendix in the RISC OS User Guide before using this
program - it obliterates all the information on the
hard disc.
