CallASWI 0.03
=============
History

  CallASWI 0.01
  -------------
  With the introduction of the StrongARM processor and the accompanying
  update to RISC OS 3.70,a module "CallASWI" was made available which 
  implemented the four new SWIs which were added for users of the older 
  RISC OS 3.60,3.50,and 3.10.

  This enabled application programmers and library writers to use the new
  calls freely without any worries about backwards compatibility. There is no
  performance penalty for the use of these SWIs via the CallASWI module. One
  slight caveat is that older machines will not know the names of these SWIs;
  they would have to be called by number from BASIC.

  CallASWI added the following 4 SWIs
              OS_CallASWI
              OS_CallASWIR12
              OS_PlatformFeatures
              OS_SynchroniseCodeAreas

  CallASWI 0.02
  -------------
  This had a minor bug fix to ensure Service_Reset was trapped so that the
  module ensured that the SWIs remained available over a BREAK or CTRL-BREAK

The latest release of CallASWI (0.03) adds another 4 SWIs which have been 
introduced to RISC OS 5.00 and later.
These are
              OS_LeaveOS (&7C)
              OS_ReadLine32 (&7D)
              OS_SubstituteArgs32 (&7E)
              OS_HeapSort32 (&7F)

The details of the latter three SWIs are covered elsewhere in the 32 bit 
documentation,the extra SWI "OS_LeaveOS" has the opposite sense to "OS_EnterOS"
and likewise takes no parameters.
The advantage of OS_LeaveOS is that it will cause callbacks to occur which
can massively improve applications where only a quick bit of work is required
in supervisor mode,yet it may be some time before any callbacks are triggered.

Again,there is a caveat in that BASIC wont be able to perform a name to number
lookup on the SWI name.

Applications authors can now freely use the new SWIs in their programs and not
worry about backwards compatibility by adding a line such as
   *RMENSURE UtilityModule 5.00 RMLOAD System:Modules.CallASWI
   *RMENSURE CallASWI 0.03 Error You need CallASWI 0.03 or later for !MyApp
to their !Run file.

Version 0.03 includes all of the features of earlier versions which are now
obsolete,applications authors should now freely distribute the newer version.
