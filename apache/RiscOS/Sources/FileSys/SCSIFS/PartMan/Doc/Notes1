Partman is a partition manager to interact with SCSIFS (at present)

It uses the GPT partitionong scheme and contains relevant code to
partition a disc and format up to 7 partitions.

Additional formatters can be added, but at present it formats
to filecore spec and also containd a FAT16 formatter (which is of
little use at this stage). These formatters are based on original
work bu J Ballance at Castle in support of their scsi partitioning
system.

The sequence of events is:

1: If a new scsi device is plugged in the SCSIAttched service call
is issued. This notifies PartMan of another device. Conversely the
SCSIDetached call does the opposite.

2: SCSIFS at a stage later starts issues a SCSIMounting service
call for this ID. PartMan uses this as a hint to load the partition
table and discover any mountable partitions. If there are any it does
as required to provide the base offset of the first such partition.
Towards the end of this loop SCSIFS issues a Partman_MorePartitions SWI.
If there are further partitions available then SCSIFS repeats the loop
until there are no more partitions reported.

At this stage limitations in SCSIFS relistically allow population
of drives scsi::4-7 from 'hard discs' and 0-3 from usb pens (marked
as removable). Additional work would improve this but at this stage
mods to SCSIFS are minimal.

The !MkRam will also build 2 executables. 'gpttst' formats scsi
ID 1 with 4 equal sized filecore partitions. 'fmat_tst' formats
scsi ID 1 with 1 filecore layout with no partitioning. Both of
these demonstrate the use of the partitioning and formatting code.

The Filecore formatting is 'Good' but non optimal as it tends to
produce larger that ideal LFAU settings. This will be resolved
in due course.

Filecore formatting now works more in line with expectation with
large discs. (There was an error in computing the max usable zones
which meant that the zonecount was 8 bit only).
