Use of PRISMLib - what does the library require of its clients?
===============================================================

* Callout
  -------

  To use the Callout facilities, the component must be a module. It
  must include the following two generic veneer declarations in its
  CMHG file:

    generic-veneers: prismlib_tick_entry/prismlib_tick_handler,
                     prismlib_callout_entry/prismlib_callout_handler

  The entries are only needed if you make calls to the PRISMLib
  callout functions.


* NRLists, NRArrays, Clients
  --------------------------

  To use the NRLists, NRArrays or NRClients facilities, the component
  must have used the Messages facilities to open a Messages file and
  defined tokens for the following PRISM public errors:

    prism_ERROR_MEMORY_EXHAUSTED
    prism_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETERS

  Presently these map to message tokens E00 and E06 respectively.
  E06 takes a single parameter. Two examples each of valid
  definitions are:

    E00:PRISM could not claim enough memory
    E06:Invalid parameters (%0) in PRISM

    E00:PTL Stream could not claim enough memory
    E06:Invalid parameters (%0) in PTL Stream

  More or less every PRISM module will tend to define this set of
  errors anyway as they are part of the PRISM public block, though
  technically they will only be required by PRISMLib if the Lists
  functions are used.
