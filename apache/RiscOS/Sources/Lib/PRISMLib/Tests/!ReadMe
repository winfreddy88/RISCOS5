PRISMLib tests - notes
======================

The following things are tested:

  Clients
  Handles
  Locks
  Interrupts (.h, via. Locks; SVC mode only)
  FuncTypes  (.h, via. NRArrays; only some definitions, not all)
  NRArrays
  JobQueues

The following things are not tested explicitly, but implicitly
as the test harness itself relies on them:

  Errors
  Messages

The following things are not tested as they are imported from
other locations and were tested there. It is assumed, due to
time pressures, that the import process introduced no errors.

  CLI
  RLists
  Timers

The following things are not tested here as they have already
been in use in real code for some time and tested that way.

  Errors
  Messages
  RLists
  Timers
  NRLists (except new function prismlib_nrl_find, which is tested fully)
  Mechanism

The following things are untested due to time pressures:

  TLV
  PTLOptions (not fully functional at the time of writing anyway)
