/* --------------------------- txtscrap_setselect --------------------------
 * Description:   Calls txt_setselect(t, from, to) and remembers t.
 *                If another txt object currently holds the selection
 *                then this is first cleared.
 *
 * Parameters:    txt t -- text object
 *                txt_index from -- array index of start of selection
 *                txt_index to -- array index of end of selection
 *                (i.e. first character not in the selection).
 *
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    If "from" >= "to" then the selection will be unset, and
 *                t will not be remembered as holding the current selection.
 *                A txt must not be destroyed while still holding the
 *                selection, please clear the selection first.
