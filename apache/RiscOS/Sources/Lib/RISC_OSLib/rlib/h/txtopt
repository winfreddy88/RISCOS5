/* ----------------------------- txtopt_set_name ---------------------------
 * Description:   Set the name used as a system variable for setting text
 *                editing options
 *
 * Parameters:    char *name -- the name to be prepended to $Options to form
 *                              the system variable name.
 * Returns:       void.
 * Other Info:    If this function is not called before using any of the
 *                txt and txtedit functions, the system variable name
 *                defaults to Edit$Options.
 *                eg. txtopt_set_name("MyEdit") sets the system variable name
 *                to MyEdit$Options

 * Parameters:    void.
 * Returns:       pointer to name
 * Other Info:    If no name has been set, this will point to "Edit".
 *                eg. assuming option name is currently MyEdit$Options
 *                then txtopt_get_name will return a pointer to the string
 *                "MyEdit".
