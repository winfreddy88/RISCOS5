; Macro for declaring the existence of architecture-specific variants of
; routines, to allow shared library clients to be linked directly to the most
; optimal routine
; N.B. stub 'Entry' macros must link to symbol |xxx$variant| in order for the
; variants to be detected
; N.B. currently only features which have a safe default of 0 can be tested for
; - features where the safe default is 1 (MUL Rd == Rn restriction, etc.) will
; need some modifications making to PickRoutineVariant.
;
; Variant symbols have a byte offset of 1, allowing the stub setup code to
; detect the presence of a variant entry just by looking at the alignment of the
; pointer (no need to update Entry's to reflect whether variants in use)
;
; Note that a suffix of '$variant' was chosen so that the '$' would prevent the
; symbol name being included in the embedded ROM debug symbols - This makes
; sure that (when variants aren't required) the original function name is the
; only one that makes it into the debug symbols.
