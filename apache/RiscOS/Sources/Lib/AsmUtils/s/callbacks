; Title:   s.callbacks
; Purpose: 'Usermode do-nothing' function to enable callbacks to fire
;

; Enclosed is the source to the function usermode_donothing.  This drops you
; into user mode, does an OS_LeaveOS (or OS_Byte 0,1 if that SWI is absent)
; and then returns to supervisor mode.
; On returns from the SWI called in user mode, callbacks are collected.

; Pre-condition: processor is in SVC26 or SVC32 mode
; Post-condition: processor is in same mode as on entry
