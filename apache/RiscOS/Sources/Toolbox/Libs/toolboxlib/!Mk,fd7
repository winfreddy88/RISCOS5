| This was prefix.  PREFIX DOES NOT WORK IN THE BUILD.  ALWAYS USE DIR INSTEAD.
Dir <Obey$Dir>

| If you have Makatic, you should auto-generate the library
| Makefile and launch it with something like this:
|
|   Makatic.Makatic3 -e -o <Obey$Dir>.AutoGenMF -d <Obey$Dir> -t <Obey$Dir>.TemplateMF -m "CCExtra=-zps1" -a
|
| If you enable the Makatic line above, don't forget to
| comment out the amu_machine line below.
|
| Since Makatic cannot be included in the standard shared
| source distribution, a previously generated AutoGenMF is
| included herein, which needs to be manually maintained
| if you don't have the means to regenerate it otherwise.

amu_machine -f AutoGenMfS all
