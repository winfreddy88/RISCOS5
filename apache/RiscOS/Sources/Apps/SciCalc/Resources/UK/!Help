                        !SciCalc
                        ========

SciCalc is a scientific calculator which offers 4
numeric bases, 3 trigonometric modes, a memory
and a single level of brackets. Input can be
performed using the mouse and the keyboard, and
intermediate calculation steps are shown in its
summary bar.

1. System requirements
======================

SciCalc requires the following resources, which should be located in the !System directory.

FPEmulator, 3.40 or later.
BASIC64 (BBC BASIC VI), 1.05 or later.


2. Basic operation
==================

Once loaded, clicking on the application icon in the iconbar will open the main calculator window. By default, this will be in 'Standard' view. You can toggle between this view and the 'Scientific' view by clicking on the Toggle icon in the window's Title Bar, or by clicking [Menu] over the calculator window and selecting 'View > Standard' or 'View > Scientific' from the main menu. You can also press [Ctrl]+[S] to toggle views.

The display field at the top of the window contains the most recently entered number or result. Any errors (such as 'Division by zero') are displayed here too. To clear an error, use the [C] button. Clicking in the calculator window will give the application the input focus, allowing you to type values into the calculator rather than use the mouse.

When in the Scientific view, you can change the numeric base and the trigonometric mode from popup menus. Changing between bases results in the number in the display field being converted. Note that changing from a decimal to a non-decimal base will round the currently displayed value to the nearest integer, but has no effect on previous parts of the current calculation. Rounding also occurs on numbers being recalled from memory in non-decimal bases.

The result in the display field can be copied to the global clipboard by selecting 'Edit > Copy' from the main menu. The summary bar can be copied to the clipboard by selecting 'Edit > Copy Summary'.

Further help on individual functions can be found by running the Help application from your Apps directory, and hovering the mouse over the button you need information on.

User choices can be set from the 'Choices' entry in the iconbar menu. The 'Quit' entry on the iconbar menu quits the application in the normal way.


3. Advanced functions
=====================

Trigonometric functions
-----------------------

SciCalc offers tangent [TAN], cosine [COS], sine [SIN], arctan [ATN], arccos [ACS] and arcsin [ASN] functions. Enter a digit into the calculator display, then click on a trigometric function button to give the result. The main display will show the result, while the Summary Bar will display the function name. To use Hyperbolic functions, click the [HYP] button before clicking the required trigonometric function button.


Percentages
-----------

The percentage button can be used in two ways. To find 15% of 47.3, enter [15], followed by the [%] button, then multiply the result by 47.3. To add 15% of 47.3 to itself, simply enter 47.3 + 15 followed by the [%] button. The main display will show the result, and the Summary Bar will resord the percentage.


4. Key shortcuts

4. Choices
==========

Open the Choices window by clicking 'Choices' from the iconbar menu.

You can choose which view the calculator window will default to from the 'Start-up settings' section. If you opt to start in Scientific view, you can also specify base and trigonometric settings.

In the 'Appearance' section, if you choose 'Use current desktop settings' then SciCalc will make use of any alternative themes you may have installed for your desktop. If you prefer to keep the default set of graphics for the main window, select 'Use application defaults'. Select 'Open calculator on start-up' to automatically open the calculator window when you run the application.

To save your changes, click [Save] or press [Enter]. The changes will only take effect next time you start the application.

From the main calculator window's menu, you can also opt to have the SciCalc window open at the same location when the application next starts. Click on 'View > Remember position'.
