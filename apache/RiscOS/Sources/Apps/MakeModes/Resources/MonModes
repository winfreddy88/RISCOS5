# MonModes: This file specifies which base mode files are to be scanned
# for each type of monitor that can be specified while generating a set
# of modes. The monitor type field is actually a string; it need not be
# numerical. Any number of file names can be given, but they must all be
# on one line. The files all live in the BaseModes directory inside the
# !MakeModes application; within this directory there are two sub-direct-
# ories called VESA and non-VESA. Which one is used is determined by a
# switch that is set on the iconbar menu. The file names are relative to
# one or other of these directories, which must therefore contain identical
# sets of files.
