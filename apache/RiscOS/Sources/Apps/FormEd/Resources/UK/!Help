 Purpose     : Editing Template Files
 Description :

              FormEd is an editor of Template files.  To understand this 
              you need to understand the program interface of the Window 
              Manager, described  in the  Programmer's Reference Manual. 
              The  description here assumes an understanding of template 
              files.

              FormEd  is  started  by double-clicking on a template file 
              after  the  FormEd  icon  has been "seen". This will cause 
              FormEd  to be loaded, and to display all of the windows in
              the template file.   Alternatively, double-click on FormEd 
              itself and it will be loaded with no current windows. If a
              template  file does not appear to load properly, give more 
              memory  to  FormEd before it starts using the Task Manager 
              window.
                                     
              A  template  file is often constructed with reference to a 
              specific set of sprites. A sprite file can be dragged onto 
              the  FormEd  icon  on  the  icon  bar to set the available 
              sprites. These are displayed in a window.      To edit the
              sprites, use the Paint application.
          
              The menu provided from the icon bar provides the following 
              functions:
                
                          Info
                            - program information
                          New template 
                            - shows a new browser window
                          Quit 
                            - quit FormEd

                  
              The  template windows displayed by FormEd mirror precisely 
              the  size,  position  and properties of the windows in the 
              Template file.   The following actions directly affect the
              stored values:

                          Close the window 
                            - removes the window from view
                          Move/scroll/resize the window 
                            - moves the default setup of the window in the
                              template file.

              Clicking  MENU  on  a template window produces a menu tree 
              that  allows  a  wide  variety  of alterations to the menu 
              structure, based on the various control fields of a window
              structure as described in the Wimp documentation.  It also
              allows you to create icons in the window.    An icon, once 
              created,  can  be  moved and resized using drag-SELECT and 
              drag-ADJUST.   It can also have its properties adjusted by 
              pointing  at  it and then clicking MENU, and following the
              "amend icon" submenu.

              Your ability to drag and resize icons may be affected by a
              button  type  affixed  to an icon: only those button types 
              which  generate the appropriate Wimp events can be dragged
              and resized directly. It's interesting to note that FormEd
              keeps  no data structures describing each template window,
              relying on the Wimp to keep and manipulate each structure.

              FormEd keeps a file of sprites in memory which can be used
              in icons in  the template  being edited.    This  optional 
              sprite file is the file Default inside  FormEd   (which is
              in fact a copy of the sprites found in the RISC OS 3 ROM).
              To  load  in  a separate  sprite  file  to  use with  your
              template file, drag the sprite file onto the FormEd icon.
