2. Outstanding Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.   19-Feb-90: IDJ:  due to bugs in edit display code, work area width has 
                      to currently be limited to 192 chars.
                      Bug manifests itself when width > 196 chars
2.   19-Feb-90: IDJ:  I'm concerned that users of RISC_OSlib, who have used
                      the old messages file, need to get a new messages
                      file to use the new library!
3.   20-Feb-90: IDJ:  setting of work area width only allowed when 'wrap' is 
                      turned off (is this right?)

3. Product Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   This document describes the text editor (!SrcEdit) included in the 
Desktop Development Environment.

   The existing text editor (!Edit) lacks certain functionality, which is of 
use to the programmer when working on program sources.  The following has 
been identified as a minimum requirement for an editor which is part of an 
integrated software development environment under the desktop:
    - the ability to save all modified buffers, and close all edits.
    - user-configurable work area width (to allow editing  of texts wider 
                                         than the physical screen without 
                                         wraparound).
    - improved search/replace facilities.
    - enlarged help information on library functions etc.
    - additional 'twin-like' user key functions.
    - support for compiler/assembler throwback (ie giving you a suitable edit
                                                window on the text in which 
                                                an error was found)
    - saveable display options.
    - selectable file names to be loaded via source path.
    - warning of multiple edits on the same document.
    - creation of files of type makefile (0x0fe1)


4. Concepts and Definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Since !SrcEdit is an extension to the existing !Edit application, we shall
only describe the differences between these two products.  In this document, 
we take Development Version 1.19 (07-Dec-89) of !Edit to be our point of 
reference.  Note that since some of the features of !SrcEdit are to be 
implemented as changes to the Shared C Library (with RISC_OSlib extensions), 
they will also become features of any future releases of !Edit. Such cases 
will be explicitly highlighted in this document by preceding their section
heading with a (*).
   The term 'throwback' is used to describe the case, where a translator 
tool has detected error(s) in a source file, and informs the editor, which
will allow the user to browse through these errors, and will open the
appropriate source files on demand.    

5. User Interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   There follows a description of !SrcEdit's user interface, mainly centred 
around the above list of desirable features.  Many references are made to the
accompanying draw files (menus and dboxes).  Where such references are made,
window identifers are given in double quotes.

  i) SrcEdit$Options

       In addition to the options supported by !Edit, !SrcEdit has
       the following options:

            1.  p<language>  - set language to 'language', for use when 
                               requesting help, and specifying selection 
                               load paths [see later].
            2.  i<list>      - add <list> to the search paths used when
                               attempting to load a selected filename.
            3.  e1           - turn "warn multiple edits" off (default is on)

     SrcEditLib$Options
             
       !SrcEdit and !Edit now have the following extra option.  In !SrcEdit,
       this is held in the system variable SrcEditLib$Options: 

       (*)  a<integer>   - set work area width to 'integer' 
                           system font characters.
       
       

  ii) Main Menu

        The structure of the main menu is shown in "MainMenu" in the
      draw file.  Actions associated with menu entries are as follows:
        
        Entry                   Action
        -----                   ------
        Info                    Give dialogue box showing prog version etc.
        Save All                Save all modified buffers
        Save Options            Save currently set options in 
                                <SrcEdit$Dir>.options
        Create                  Submenu as shown in "SubCreate"
        Options                 Submenu as shown in "SubOptions"
        Quit                    Exit !SrcEdit (prompting if modified
                                               buffers unsaved).

     Submenu "SubCreate"
     -------------------
        In addition to the usual !Edit file types which can be created from
     this submenu, there is also an entry to create new files of type
     0x0fe1 (Makefile).

     Submenu "SubOptions"
     --------------------
        This menu allows !SrcEdit options to be set (in addition to those
     settable from per-window menus in !Edit):
        
        Entry                   Action
        -----                   ------
        Warn Multiple Edits     enabled ==> warns when an attempt is made to
                                            load a file which is already in
                                            an edit buffer, and has been
                                            modified
                                disabled ==> behaves as in !Edit

        Language                sets up environment for a named language
                                (language name is chosen from submenu).
                                The submenu shows all languages for which
                                an entry has been made in
                                <SrcEdit$Dir>.resources.languages 

        Search Path             allows user to enter a comma-separated
                                list of directories to search when loading
                                from a selection [see later].



 iii) Per-window menus

        There are two changes to the per-window menus provided by !Edit;
      one is the Display submenu, the other is the Select sub-menu.
      These are in the draw file as "SubDisplay" and "SubSelect".

      Submenu "SubSelect"
      -------------------
        All entries are as in !Edit, plus two extra entries as described
      below:

        Entry         Action
        -----         ------
        Help          Displays dialogue box ("Help") containing a four line 
                      description of the selected area of text 
                      (max 64 chars of selection)
                      eg. for C, highlighting printf would give, say:
                      Header: <stdio.h>
                      Prototype: int printf(const char *format, ...)
                      In order to get help for a particular language, the
                      user must first have set the 'Language' option
                      appropriately from the main !SrcEdit menu, or via
                      SrcEdit$Options.
                      The keyboard shortcut for help is Ctrl-?.

        Load          Loads file corresponding to the selected area of the
                      text.  The order in which directories are tried is
                      as follows:
                       a. Assuming the file within which the selection is
                          made is DirectoryPath.LanguageExtension.foo, 
                          try to load DirectoryPath.Selection
                       b. If "a" fails try the comma-separated list of
                          directories entered by the user from the
                          "Search Path" entry in the "Options" submenu of
                          the main !SrcEdit menu. This list can also be set
                          as an entry in SrcEdit$Options.
                       c. If "b" fails, next try the comma-separated list
                          of directories found in file 
                          SrcEdit$Dir.resources.searchpath

                      The keyboard shortcut for load is Ctrl-L.



(*)  Submenu "SubDisplay"
     --------------------
       All entries are as in !Edit, plus an extra entry "Work Area" as
     described below:

        Entry         Action
        -----         ------
        Work Area     Display writeable menu entry, which allows the user
                      to enter the maximum width of an edit window.
                      This is specified in terms of the number of system font
                      characters which are displayed before the window wraps.
                      This option is not available when "wrap" is turned on,
                      and has a maximum value of 192 characters.  
  
(*) iv) New Search/Replace Facilities

        A new dialogue box is displayed for serching for strings in a text.
     The new format is as shown in the "Find" window in the accompanying
     draw file.
        As in !Edit, the user enters the string to be searched for in a
     writeable icon (similarly for the replacement string.
        The "case-sensitive" option icon works as in !Edit.
        When the user clicks SELECT on the 'magic characters' option icon,
     the dialogue box grows to display a number of button icons used for
     entering 'magic' character sequences, as described below.  Alternatively
     these characters can be entered directly from the keyboard.
        The 'magic' characters and their meanings are:

        Character    Icon Name     Meaning
        ---------    ---------     -------
           .         Any           matches any single character.
           $         Newline       matches end-of-line.
           @         Alphanum      matches a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _.
           #         Digit         matches 0-9.
           |c        Ctrl          matches CTRL-c.
           \c        Normal        matches c, even if c is magic.
           [abc]     Set[/]Set     matches any one of a, b, c.
                                   Note: a set is ALWAYS case-sensitive.
           c1-c2     To            c1-c2 matches any character between c1 and
                                   c2 in the character set.
           „nn       Hex           matches the character given as a hex
                                   value nn.
           ~c        Not           if c is any of the above simple character
                                   patterns, then ~c matches any character
                                   other than c.
           *c        0 or More     if c is any of the above simple character
                                   patterns, then *c matches 0 or more
                                   occurrences of c.
           ^c        1 or More     if c is any of the above simple character
                                   patterns, then ^c matches 1 or more
                                   occurrences of c.
           %c        Most          if c is any of the above simple character
                                   patterns, then %c matches the most
                                   contiguous characters matching c
         
           &         Found         the found string.
                                   Note: this can only be used in the
                                   replacement string.
           ?n        Field         if a pattern was found which matched the
                                   search string, then ?n refers to the
                                   part of the found string which matched
                                   the n'th ambiguous part of the search 
                                   string. 0<=n<=9.
                                   Note: this can only be used in the
                                   replacement string.

     Badly formed search strings are reported by a wimp error box.
                                   
           
  (*) v) Saveable options

            Options which are used by RISC_OSlib are held in 
        SrcEditLib$Options, and !SrcEdit's own options are held in 
        SrcEdit$Options (eg. warn multiple edits etc).  These can be
        saved for future use by clicking on the 'Save Options' entry
        in !SrcEdit's main menu.


     vi) Warning of Multiple Edits
              
           If the user has enabled the 'Warn Multiple Edits' option on the
        editor main menu, and attempts to open a opy of a file which is
        already modified in a current edit buffer, a dialogue box appears
        ("MultiEdit").  The mouse is restricted to the bounding box of
        the dialogue box.
           Displayed in the dialogue box is the message:
           Modified buffer already exists for <filename> .
           The user can then click on any of the three action icons shown
        at the bottom of the dialogue box, with the following effects:
         
          Icon             Action
          ----             ------
          Read-only Copy   The opened file is still displayed in a new
                           window, but is only scrollable (not editable).
                           The word Read-Only is appended to the text in the
                           window's title bar.
          Editable Copy    The same as a normal !Edit window.
          Cancel Edit      The new window on the open file is closed, and its
                           edit buffer discarded.
                           

     vii) Support for compiler/assembler throwback
   
            The purpose of throwback is to allow translators (compilers/
          assemblers) to signal the editor when they have detected source 
          errors.  On receiving such a signal, !SrcEdit displays a window 
          ("Errors") which shows the name of the file which was being 
          processed when the error(s) were found, the name of the file in 
          which the error(s) were found, and the relevant line number.
          Also displayed is the level of severity of the error(s): Serious 
          Error, Error or Warning.
            The complete list of errors is shown in a scrollable window.
          We shall refer to a single line of this window as an "error line".  
          The user can scroll through these as with any normal text window, 
          using the vertical and horizontal scroll bars.
            Double-clicking SELECT on an error line opens an edit window on 
          the appropriate file (if it is not already open), and highlights 
          the line containing the selected error.  The selected error line
          is also highlighted in the scrollable error window.
            The user can then proceed to correct that error, or move on to
          another error line in the window.  Clicking ADJUST on an error line
          removes it from the list (presumably the user has either corrected
          the error or has chosen to ignore it).  [Note that error line 
          numbers refer to the original source when it was processed.  The 
          user may, in the course of correcting errors, insert or delete 
          lines;  the position in the
          source where errors were detected remains correct despite user
          edits (provided that the edits are made as a consequence of
          throwback, of course).
            This process is carried out whilst the compilation is in 
          progress.  As new errors are reported they  become visible in the 
          window, until no more can be displayed.  To get at more errors the
          user must explicitly scroll the window. 


     viii) Bracket matching
            By placing the caret immediately BEFORE an opening bracket (ie
          one of '(' '{' '[') and pressing F10, !SrcEdit can be made to
          highlight its corresponding closing bracket.
            By placing the caret immediately AFTER a closing bracket (ie
          one of ')' '}' ']') and pressing F10, !SrcEdit can be made to
          highlight its corresponding opening bracket. 
            The 'caret' stays where it was. This arrangement is especially
          useful when used in conjunction with other keyboard shortcuts;
          for example, finding a corresponding bracket and pressing F6,
          will highlight the whole bracketted expression; pressing Ctrl-F7
          will toggle the caret and selection thus showing the matching
          bracket pair.

6. Programmer Interface
-----------------------
   When a wimp-task compiler/assembler which supports a 'throwback' option
detects error(s) in the source it is processing, it needs to inform an editor
what and where the errors were.

   In order to communicate with an editor the compiler/assembler should
behave as follows:
      On detecting source errors the following wimp message should be
      broadcast (recorded delivery):

      +16                     DDE_Throwback (reason code)
      +20                     initial throwback identifier

      This will be acknowledged by the editor using the Wimp's 
      acknowledgement mechanism.

   The translator then passes messages giving full information on each error
to the editor which gives the user the aforementioned dialogue box view on
the errors.

   A complete series of messages sent by the translator to the editor is
described by the grammar below.  Items in <..> are individual wimp
messages, identified by there reason code.  [Aside: multiple messages
are needed because of the wimp limit on message size (256 bytes)]

   ErrorDialogue ::= ErrorsWhileProcessing {ErrorsWhileProcessing}
                     <DDE_EndThrowback>

   ErrorsWhileProcessing ::= <DDE_ProcessingFile>
                             ErrorFoundIn {ErrorFoundIn}

   ErrorFoundIn ::= <DDE_ErrorIn> <DDE_ErrorDetails>


   The format of such messages is as follows:

7. Standards
------------
   Adheres to RISC OS Applications Guidelines (PRM p.1300).


8. Data Interchange
-------------------
   Plain text.


9. Data Formats
---------------
   Languages file format
   ---------------------
   When a language translator (compiler/assembler) is incorporated into the
DDE, the file !SrcEdit.resources.languages should have a line appended to it
of the form:
   <language name><newline>
   <default load path for loading files from a selection>
   <filename of help file>

   Help file format
   ----------------
   A help file is intended to provide language-specific help for a selection within an
edited document.  For each recognised item for which help is available, there should be
an entry in the help file of the form:
   %<keyword>
   <line 1 of help text>
   <line 2 of help text>
   <line 3 of help text>
   <line 4 of help text>
   It is not necessary to include 4 lines of help text, but this is the maximum
allowable.  A line can have a maximum of 64 characters.  Lines beginning with a #
are taken as comments, and ignored.
      

10. External Dependencies
-------------------------
    Uses the Shared C Library (with RISC_OSlib extensions).


11. Acceptance Test
-------------------
    Should not have any more bugs than !Edit (!).
    Same speed performance as !Edit.


12. Product Organisation
------------------------
    Is part of the DDE.


13. Future Enhancements
-----------------------
    Make the editor programmable.
    Introduce more magic characters for find/replace.
    Make display of magic characters like Twin.
