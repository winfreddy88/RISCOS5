Class summary:  supports I/O through C FILE structs.
                Derived from the streambuf class.

%strstreambuf
Define in:      strstream.h
Class summary:  stores and fetches characters from arrays of bytes in memory.
                Derived from the streambuf class.

%fstream
Define in:      fstream.h
Class summary:  supports formatted I/O to and from files.         
                Derived from the iostream class.

%new
Definition:     attempts to create an object of a given type-name.
                The object's lifetime is not restricted to the scope
                in which it is created.  The new operator returns
                a pointer to the object created.
