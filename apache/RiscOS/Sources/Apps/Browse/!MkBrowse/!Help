   ~~~~~~~~~
   Purpose:  Help build browser variants.

             Since the build process writes dependency information back
             to the Makefile, DO NOT TRY TO BUILD MORE THAN ONE THING
             AT A TIME.

   Setup:

      Icon                 Action/Meaning                         Default
      ----                 --------------                         -------
      Ursula               Standard generic Desktop build.        On
                           Sets "SYSTEM=Ursula" and places the
                           output in "Targets.Ursula.!Browse".
      Phoenix              Phoenix developer's UI build.          Off
                           Sets "SYSTEM=Phoenix"; output goes
                           to the resulting default of
                           "Targets.Phoenix.!Phoenix".
      Browse               Old-fashioned Desktop build.           Off
                           Sets "SYSTEM=Browse"; output goes
                           to the resulting default of
                           "Targets.Browse.!Browse".

      No JS/Unicode        Simple build (Browse, Phoenix,         On

                           instrumentation defined in the code
                           (all variants).

                           a capable throwback handler (e.g.
