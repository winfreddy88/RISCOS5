; Purpose: The original Customer browser sources
;          used RISC_OSLib heavily and some of
;          the functions used are handy to have
;          around. This source file contains
;          a variety of functions from RISC_OSLib
;          with modifications where necessary
;          both to fit into the browser more
;          naturally, and to function better
;          under C release 5.
