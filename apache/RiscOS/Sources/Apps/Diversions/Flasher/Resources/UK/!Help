                      !Flasher
                      ========

Flasher will increase productivity when using your
RISC OS machine to run any desktop program by making
the caret flash so that it may be located more quickly
by a single glance at the screen; studies in the past
have shown that a flashing cursor can increase the
speed of normal data entry by as much as 40%.

In cases where the caret can still not be located
(eg. it is behind another window), you can click
SELECT over the Flasher icon on the icon bar to find
it wherever it is (try it and see!).

While Flasher is running, you may click on its icon bar
icon to locate the caret. This will send a message to
the window containing the caret, asking it to scroll so
that the caret is in the centre of the window and jump
to the foreground. The pointer will then be positioned
over the caret. Note that some tasks are not correctly
written and will therefore not respond to this message
in a sensible fashion.

Note that the menu also allows you to turn flashing on
and off and also has a Find option; this locates the
caret in the same way as clicking on the iconbar icon.
If the caret is not currently displayed, the Find option
will be shaded out and the iconbar icon will yield a bleep.
