05-Apr-94  Take over version 1.04 from Steve Hunt.

06-Apr-94  Makefile
            Some simplifications, and "depend" and "install" targets added.

           c.extent:
            Remove references to OLDARROWS macro.
            Remove unused declarations of prev, next in extent_key_pressed().

           c.template:
            Remove references to NOBACKLINKS macro.
            Remove reference to OLDSPRAREA macro.
            Remove unused declarations of type, item, new, closure.

           c.grid:
            Remove reference to OLDARROWS macro.

           c.main:
            Remove reference to TESTTESTTEST macro.

           Templates, h.icons:
            "Info" template now has identifiable "Version" field.

           h.resed:
            VERSION_NUMBER #define added; set to 1.05.
            #include "version.h" added.

           c.version, h.version:
            New source file which supplies function to generate a version
             string for the Info box.

           MakeProto:
            c.version added to list of CFILES, but not to list of OFILES;
             instead, this source file is explicitly compiled and linked
             whenever a new !RunImage is made. This makes sure that each new
             !RunImage always has the date when the image was linked as part
             of the version string.

********   SrcFiler version 002 made from version 1.05 (06-Apr-94)   ********

12-Apr-94  doc.spec:
            Updated to reflect current behaviour; checked back in to source
            tree, but no new version made.
