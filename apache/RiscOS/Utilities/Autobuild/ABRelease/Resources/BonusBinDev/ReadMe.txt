RISC OS Open Release Archive
============================

This is a set of bonus applications and modules primarily of interest to
developers. It is a bleeding-edge build which comes from the latest revisions
of all the relevant sources in our source code repository and is completely
untested.

Beware that some of the components have fallen into a state of disrepair, lack
internationalisation or are anachronistic in some other way and are thus
considered unsuitable for inclusion on the standard HardDisc4 disc image. They
are provided nonetheless as from a developer's point of view the perils of
using them outweigh the problem of them not being available at all.
