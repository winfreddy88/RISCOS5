| Script to test if two different versions of Squish produce the same output
| Rename existing Library.Build.Squish to OldSquish, copy in your new version
| as NewSquish, and add this script as Squish.
| Note - errors probably won't halt the build, so it's best to check the log
| manually rather than relying on the build failing.
