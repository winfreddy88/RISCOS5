This is a copy of the RISC OS 5 source code taken from CVS on 28 December 2018.

No CVS history has been retained, the purpose of this repository is just to
create a frozen version of the RISC OS 5 tree, as it looked on this particular
day.

It is not updated, maintained, or intended for any other purpose, other than to
capture the source code tree at a single moment in time. This is useful for
those that want to search the source code using the github search interface,
for code that is likely stable in the RISC OS source tree.

I hope that at some point, live (up-to-date) RISC OS 5 source code, with
history, might be made available via git, but that is not what this repository
is.
