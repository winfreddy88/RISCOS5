UtilLib
=======

UtilLib is a simple library to assist with writing transient utilities in C.

To use it, you have a choice: you can either write your utility starting with
a function declared as follows:

_kernel_oserror *main(int argc, char *argv[])

which will produce a warning at compilation time, which you can ignore; or
the more traditional:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])

which is warning-free, but you should note that the return value is treated
as a pointer to an error block anyway - so in practice, you will often end
up explicitly casting an error block pointer to an int in your return
statement anyway. In either case, if the return value is non-zero, UtilLib
will set the V flag before returning to the OS.

The Shared C Library doesn't currently have support for transient utilities.
To interface with the OS, you can do one of the following:
* link with ansilib (though this will add to your binary size, and not all
  entry points will be functional without the library having been initialised)
* link with OSLib
* use the intrinsic __swi() function
* use the inline assembler to call SWIs

Remember that this also means that many language support functions may not be
available - there is no heap, so you cannot use malloc() or free(), and stack
extension will not be functional, so you must compile all source files using
-zps1.

To link your transient utility, use the command line:

link -util

if you have link 5.36 or later. On ealier versions, you can achieve something
similar using

link -rmf -nozeroinit

although this will not insert the header required for compatibility with
RISC OS Adjust32, nor the footer required to enable native 32-bit execution
on RISC OS 5 when Aemulor is installed.
