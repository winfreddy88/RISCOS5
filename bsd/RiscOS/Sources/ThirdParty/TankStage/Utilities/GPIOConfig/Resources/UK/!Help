Setup file for use with GPIO pin configuration.
The file will initially be saved from the GPIOConfig application, but the contents of the
file will be used by the users program to setup a GPIO congiguration.
Pressing the Save Config button opens a save window where the file can be dragged to a
location of your choice.
Drag a saved file onto the app window to load that file configuration.
Press Select on the Iconbar Icon to open the setup window.
If any MCP23017 I2C extenders are connected, pressing Adjust will open a window to control
those.

If you click Menu over one of the "Pins", you can set the Mode for that pin.
The outline of the "Pin" shows Red if its GPIO input, Green if GPIO output and
Black for other modes.
Click adjust over one and if it is set as GPIO mode, then it will toggle between
input and output as shown by the colour of the "Pin" outline.
Click Select over one and if it is set as GPIO mode output, then it will toggle between
On and Off as shown by the "Pin".

BeagleBoard specific
USB1, MMC3 and MM1 will load the configuration selected into the Aux Connector pins.
UART2, MMC2 will load the confifuration into the Exp onnector pins.
The I2C protection only sets the protection for the pins in the setup, so you will
need to issue the GPIO_EnableI2C with r0=1 from your program to actually protect them.
Please note that some configurations are mutually exclusive, so you need to check the pin
usage if you wish to use them.


Raspberry Pi specific
UART and SPIO will load the configuration selected into the Aux Connector pins.
The I2C protection only sets the protection for the pins in the setup, so you will
need to issue the GPIO_EnableI2C with r0=1 from your program to actually protect them.
