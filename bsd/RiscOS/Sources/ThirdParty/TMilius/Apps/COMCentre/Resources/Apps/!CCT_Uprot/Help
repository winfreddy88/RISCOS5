Choose an according communication device. Afterwards the protection status of
the device will be shown towards you. If the device is protected you can
enter your PIN and afterwards press Enter or choose "Unprotect" from the
menu. If this is correct and unprotection is successful the application will
close automatically. If your PIN is not correct you have further attempts.
However be careful, After a certain number of wrong attempts your SIM card
may be locked permanently. The application counts the attempts but it is only
aware of the attempts since starting the application.

The application may be called automatically in case that other programs or
commands are detecting that a device is protected.
