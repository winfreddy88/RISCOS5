Click on the communication device shown in the list you want to use for communication.
The possible actions (Connect/Disconnect) will show you the actual status of the
internet connection of the device. If both are disabled the device in status of
connecting/disconnecting or yes there is an internal error. This would be possible
to repair but it is easier to restart your machine. Choosing Connect/Disconnect you
will start/terminate your wireless internet connection. You will get a message box
showing you the sucess or failure after a while.

WARNING: Wireless Internet connections are still very expensive compared to DSL
connections. Don't forget to terminate your connection.

NOTE: In case that you don't have configured the right access from configuration
you won't get a connection.

NOTE: A connection can be terminated by your internet provider or in case
that access to an according base station is no longer available.

Internally the connection makes usage of the PPP module so you can use the
according analytic command like PPPlog or PPPInfo to examine problems. When a
connection is starting the actual default route will be stored internally and
(hopefully) restored afterwards.
