ModTerm is a small terminal program to test the AT-commands of a modem.
It is finished by entering a §.

If more than one possible modem is availble you will get a list of available devices.
Choose one of them to continue. If only one modem is available you will directly enter
the dialogue mode.

Type beginning with AT. Lines are ended by pressing a return. Usually the modem will
sent a reply to you after doing so. ModTerm displays the echo of the characters you
are typing not the typed character itself. So if you are not getting the character
you type on the screen the modem is not accepting it. There may be various reasons
for this. Eg. the modem may be in transmission mode or you are not starting a line
with AT.

Typing

AT<return>

should display

AT
OK
