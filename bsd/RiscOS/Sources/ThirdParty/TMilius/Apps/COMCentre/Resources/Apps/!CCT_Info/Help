===========================================================================

After choosing a communication device from the drop down list some information
regarding the status of the mobile phone connection are displayed. This connection
is independently of receiving a call.

This are:

- Signal level of connection.
- IMSI (the number of your SIM card. Keep for yourself. I don't know what will
  happen if other poeple will become aware of it but I assume that this is not
  good for you.)
- Mobile phone connection status
- A list of connections generally provided in this area. You can see:
  - Kind of connection
    ! - connected
    - - not allowed for your SIM card
    + - also a possible connection for your SIM card
    ? - unkown kind of connection
  - Technology (UMTS/GPRS)
  - Name of provider

You can refresh the information by chossing "Refresh" from menu.

NOTE: Gathering the list of connections traditionally takes a while.
