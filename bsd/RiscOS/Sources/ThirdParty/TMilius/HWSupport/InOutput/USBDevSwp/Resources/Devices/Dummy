| VendorID and ProdcutID of a device may change during configuration.
| The following parameter controls the setup of an USB ALIAS which will be
| performed after the devices has been reconfigurated. In worst case
| The IDs will stay which will cause a logical conflict with USB ALIAS
| for the device change. Because most devices will keep their new
| configuration even during USB device resets until a power up the
| old ALIAS will be overwritten.
|
| Note that several TargetIDs are possible because several devices
| are using the same VendorID/POroductID. The sequence mut be kept
| in case that new devices are added. They must be appended at the end.
