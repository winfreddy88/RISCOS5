<TD>Contains modem status at exit. See FTDI documentation for
explanation of the modem status.</TD>

<TD>R0</TD>
<TD>1<<31 + 3</TD>
<TD>Set event character</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>R3</TD>
<TD></TD>
<TD>New event character at entry. See FTDI documentation for explanation
of the event character. Usually usage of event characters is disabled.
Setting the character enables usage. You can´t disable usage
afterwards until a chip reset is performed.</TD>
</TR>

<TD>R0</TD>
<TD>1<<31 + 4</TD>
<TD>Set error character</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>R3</TD>
<TD></TD>
<TD>New error character at entry. See FTDI documentation for explanation
of the error character. Usually usage of error characters is disabled.
Setting the character enables usage. You can´t disable usage
afterwards until a chip reset is performed.</TD>

<TD rowspan=2>Latency Timer</TD>
<TD>R0</TD>
<TD>1<<31 + 5</TD>
<TD>Read or set latency timer</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>R3</TD>
<TD></TD>
<TD>0 is a forbidden value for the latency timer. Therefore this value is
used to read the value of the latency timer into R3 at exit. Every other
value writes the latency timer. See FTDI documentation for explanation of the
latency timer.</TD>

</TR>
<TR>
<TD>R3</TD>
<TD></TD>
<TD><P>New FTDI chip Bit mode. The operation might failed because not every
FTDI chip implements every mode and the driver is not supported every mode.
In fact in the moment the driver supports only one mode:</P>
<UL>
<LI>0 - IO-mode (Serial device)
