<H1>Device Names, Special Fields and Blocking</H1>

<H2>Device Names and Numbers</H2>

<P>The FTDI driver must cope with different devices and interfaces. Eg. you
will have serial or parallel interfaces but also complete devices as
OBD-adapters. It is not predictionable which devices you will attach. If you
are connecting a serial to USB interface it makes sense to use "Serial" as
device name perhaps followed by a port number. For FTDI devices the device
name shall start with "FTDI." followed by interface type (eg "SERIAL.") and
then followed by a device identification (eg. "OBD"). At the end of the name
you should place a number which acts as minor device number in the device
claim protocol. The major device number for FTDI devices is hexadecimal 101D.
Note that if you are emulating eg. a serial port you must use the major
device number of a serial port (2). Inclusion of the minor number into the
device name allows applications to cope with individual configurations and
using the device claim protocol. They only have look at the end of the name
for a number. So a FTDI device name may look as follows:</P>

<P>FTDI.SERIAL.OBD2</P>

<H2>Special Fields</H2>

<P>In general a FDTI device is configured by the
<A HREF="../../Devices/ReadMe">configuration file</A>.
This file defines the allowed settings and the default with which the device
is initialized. However you can set some values in accordance to RISC OS
serial port as special field when opening a stream. But note that you
can only choose values which have been allowed inside the configuration file
else you will get an error and the opening of the stream will fail.</P>

<H2>Blocking behaviour</H2>

<P>Sleeping for taskwindows is handled by DeviceFS (Special field "sleep").
The driver also supports non blocking. However it is designed to never block
on input because it will always return EOF in case that no data is pending on
input side.</P>

<p>If using OS_BGET open the input stream in a classical way. If no data is
avaible then you will obtain a set C flag pre EOF indicator. You must reset
this before next read eg. using OS_Args 3 setting an extension of 0. </p>

<p>OS_GBPB is handled in then same way so "noblock" has no influence because
the EOF evaluation operates before noblock activity.</p>
