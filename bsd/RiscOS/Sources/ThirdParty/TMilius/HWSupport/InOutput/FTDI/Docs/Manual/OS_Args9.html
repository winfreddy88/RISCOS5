<H1>OS_Args 9 Support</H1>

<P>OS_Args 9 is still undocumented in the usual RISC OS PRMs (even 2010). It
seems that it has been introduced around 1996 and allows you to perfom some
IO-Control operations on certain fileswitch handles.</P>

<P>Fileswitch will pass the request to the according filing system. Eg. at
DeviceFS some requests are handled internally. Others are passed as a special
DeviceCall to the device drivers.</P>

<P>OS_Args 9 takes the file switch handle in R1 and a pointer to a so called
IOCTL-block in R2. The request are decoded inside this block. For the FTDI
driver this is done as follows:</P>

<P>All other codes will generate an error.</P>

<P>All this has been setup in accordance to newer RISC OS hardware drivers
for the according interfaces.</P>

<P>This concept overcomes some limitations of classic RISC OS direct port
access SWIs which are limited to exactly one port. This allows eg. terminal
programms which formerly dealt with a couple of SWIs to handle settings
like the baudrates to implement one interface valid for all ports they wish
to handle.</P>

<P>To provide implementation of full compatibility eg for control line access
it is possible to bypass OS_Args 9 which would require an open stream by
direct CallDevice actions. In this case the IOCTL-Block must be passed in R3
instead of R2.</P>
