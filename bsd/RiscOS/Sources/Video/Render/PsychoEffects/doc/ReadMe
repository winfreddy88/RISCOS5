PsychoEffect
============

Yes, sorry about the name but I‘ve got all star commands starting with Psycho
at the start registered to me (for Digital Psychosis and all that).  Anyway,
PsychoEffect is a 256 colour mode fader with dithering.  The details of its
SWI are at the top of the source file.  The files includes are

FadeSpr 	For reference, this is the fade data, created by eye, which
		the module uses. 

LinFade 	The data stripped out of FadeSpr.  This is INCBINed into
		the PsychoEffect Module at compile time.

FadeDemo 	You'll need a 256 colour MODE 15 sprite to run this.  The
		lizard file supplied with Translator is particularly good for
		this.

EffSource 	The source code for PsychoEffects.
