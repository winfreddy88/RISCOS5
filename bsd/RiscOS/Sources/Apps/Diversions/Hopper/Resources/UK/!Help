                        !Hopper
                        =======

Help the frog hop its way to safety across a busy road and over the rapids,
collecting tasty flies along the way. Watch out for the poisonous snake
and hungry crocodile.

Earn extra spare lives for each level completed, though as the levels 
progress the game gets a little harder (more traffic, more snakes, that sort
of thing).

To set up various options for Hopper, select Choices from the icon bar
menu. This brings up a window allowing you to change the control keys, music
and sound effect volume, how the high score table works, whether auto-repeat
is on, and graphics update speed and sound quality.

Four sound quality levels are used, Very High, High, Medium, and Low.
Very High requires more processor power, and hence only recommended for
people with more powerful machines. The rest use less processor as the sound
quality lessens.

Once the iconbar icon is clicked upon, you are taken into Hopper. Pressing
SPACE then begins a game. Pressing ESCAPE returns you back to the desktop.

Other keys:

     ESCAPE quits the game
     F9/F10 pause/unpauses
     F1/F2  turn sound on/off
     F5/F6  turn music on/off
