| What is Mine Hunt? |
+--------------------+

Mine Hunt is a game of luck and lateral thinking.

It is based on a game which comes free with version 3.1 of a popular PC
operating system.

To load the game, double-click on the !MineHunt application.  An icon in the
form of a mine will appear on the iconbar.  If you click on this icon, the
game board will appear.  You are now ready to start the game.

At the start of the game, you are presented with a rectangular grid of
squares.  Hidden in the grid is a specified number of mines.  The object of
the game is to locate all the mines as quickly as possible.  To achieve
this, you mark all the squares where you think there are mines and uncover
all the other squares.  If you manage this, then you have won; but if you
uncover a mine, you lose!  The score is just the number of seconds you have
taken to complete the game.  So the faster you complete the game, the better
your score.  The timer starts when you uncover the first square.

Changing the colours of the counter numerals
--------------------------------------------

Clicking on the mine/flag counter or the timer boxes will cause the colours
of the numerals to change.  This allows the numbers to be more visible in
other modes or monitors.  For example, the normal green numerals are not
very visible on the grey-scale screen on the A4 portable.

The colours cycle from: green -> light grey -> blue -> orange.



+-----------------------+
| How to play Mine Hunt |
+-----------------------+

At the start of the game, you have no idea where the mines are, so the first
few squares you uncover will have to be guesses.  One strategy is to uncover
the corner squares first.

* To 'uncover' a square, point at it and click SELECT.

If the square you have uncovered contains a mine, the the game is over. 
Mine Hunt will then show you the locations of all the mines.  The mine with
a red background is the one you just uncovered, and the mines with green
backgrounds are the mines you correctly marked.  All the other mines are the
ones you hadn't found yet.

* To start a new game, select 'New game' from the main menu, or click on the
  'man' at the top of the board.

If the square you uncovered did not contain a mine, then Mine Hunt will
display in that square a number which indicates how many of the adjacent
squares contain mines.

So, if you turn over a corner square and it shows the number '1', then you
know that one of the surrounding three squares contains a mine.  If you turn
over a square near the centre of the board and it shows the number '3' then
you know that three of the surrounding eight squares contain mines.

If the square is blank, then none of the surrounding squares contain mines. 
If this occurs, Mine Hunt will help you by uncovering all the surrounding
squares for you.  If any of those are blank, then all their neighbours will
be uncovered, and so on (giving a 'cascading' effect).

Hopefully, after a few guesses to start with, you will have enough
information to start deducing where the mines are.


Marking squares which contain mines
-----------------------------------

If you are pretty sure that an uncovered square contains a mine, then you
should mark that square.

* To mark a square you think contains a mine, click ADJUST over the square.

The square will then be marked with a little red flag.  Each time you mark a
square, the mine/flag counter in the top left of the window reduces by one. 
Note: this happens even if you incorrectly mark a square which doesn't
actually contain a mine!

For 'safety' purposes, squares marked with a flag cannot be uncovered.  This
is to protect against accidentally uncovering marked mines.  It is possible,
however, to turn off the flag so you can uncover the square (see later for
how to do this).

Keep going in this manner until you have marked all the mines and uncovered
all the other squares.  Once this happens you have won.


The 'question-mark' facility
----------------------------

You can mark an uncovered square with a question mark if you want.  You
might want to use this to mark squares you think might contain mines etc.,
while you are in the midst of the deducing process.

* To mark a square as a question mark, point at it and click ADJUST twice.

Later, you can change the question mark to a flag, or uncover it.

Note: squares with question marks are not 'protected' and can still be
      uncovered by clicking with SELECT.


Clearing flags and question marks
---------------------------------

* To clear a flag from a square, point at it and click ADJUST twice.

When you remove a flag, the mine/flag counter increases by one as expected.

* To clear a question mark from a square, point at it and click ADJUST once.


Ie. clicking with ADJUST cycles through the sequence:


     clear  -->  flag  -->  question mark  -+
       |                                    |
       +------  <-------  <-------  <-------+


The question mark on/off facility
---------------------------------

If you never use the question mark facility, then you can disable them
(for speed and convenience) by clicking on the 'Question marks' entry in
the game menu.

If question marks are turned off (ie there is no tick next to the
'Question marks' entry in the game menu), then clicking ADJUST on a flag
will clear the flag from the square.

Ie. the sequence when clicking with ADJUST becomes:

     clear  -->  flag  -+
       |                |
       +------  <-------+

To turn question marks back on, click on the 'Question marks' in the game
menu.


The 'clear-around' facility
---------------------------

To save time, Mine Hunt as a special feature where if a numbered uncovered
square has the correct number of neighbouring squares marked as mines, you
can quickly uncover the other neighbours.

* To 'clear-around' a square, point at it and then either:
   - click SELECT whilst holding down the SHIFT key, or
   - click ADJUST.

Note: this only works if the correct number of neighbouring squares have
      been marked.  Ie. if the square you are clearing around has the number
      '3' in it, then it must have three and only three neighbouring flags.

Clearing around has exactly the same effect as if you had clicked on all the
other uncovered neighbours individually.

If any of the neighbours are incorrectly marked, then clearing around will
cause you to uncover a mine and the game will be over!  So be careful!



+---------------+
| Keeping score |
+---------------+

Mine Hunt scoring is simple.  The timer in the top right corner of the
window shows your playing time.  It starts when you uncover or mark your
first square and stops when all squares are uncovered or marked.
The faster you find all the mines, the better your score. 

To see a list of the five best scores for each level, open the main menu and
select:

  High scores -> Show 



+--------------------------+
| What happens when I win? |
+--------------------------+

If you have achieved one of the five best scores for the level you are on,
then you will be asked to enter your name for the high score table.  Just
type your name and press RETURN.

The highscore table will then be opened showing your glorious achievement.



+------------------+
| Choosing a level |
+------------------+

There are five predefined levels to play at, plus a Custom level facility.
The Custom level feature is described later.

The five normal levels are summarised below.

Name           Size of board   No. of mines   % of mine squares
-------------  --------------  -------------  ------------------
Beginner          8  by 8          10              15.6 %
Better            16 by 8          20              15.6 %
Intermediate      16 by 16         40              15.6 %
Good              24 by 16         60              15.6 %
Expert            30 by 16         99              20.6 %



+----------------------------+
| Tips for playing Mine Hunt |
+----------------------------+

If an uncovered square is labelled '1', and there is only one covered
neighbouring square, then that covered square must be a mine.

The same applies if the square is labelled '3' and there are only three
neighbours which are covered or marked as mines.  Any covered squares must
be mines.

If an uncovered square already has the correct number of neighbouring mines
marked, then uncover all the other neighbours.  You can do this manually or
use the 'clear around' facility.

If at all possible, don't guess (unless you've got a four-leaf clover and
a rabbit's foot).  If you can't figure out what to uncover or mark, then try
approaching the area from a different direction.

Sometimes, however, you get in a position where you have no other choice but
to guess.  All I can say is "good luck".  Sorry!



+----------------+
| The menus etc. |
+----------------+

The iconbar menu
----------------

Pretty much self-explanatory apart from 'Save choices'.

If you click on 'Save choices' the Mine Hunt will save the following
settings:
            - Currently selected level
            - Whether sound is on or not
            - The currently set sound level (loud or quiet)
            - Whether question marks are available or not
            - What colour to use for the 'LED' display

and reinstate them as defaults when you next load the game.


The game window menu
--------------------

New game    - Starts a new game.

Level       - Choose a level to play from this submenu.

              Note 1: If any of the levels are too large for the current
                      screen mode to display then their menu entries will be
                      greyed out.

              Note 2: You cannot select the Custom level from the level
                      submenu, you need to go into the dialogue box and
                      click on OK.

Question marks
            - Turns question mark availability on or off.

Safe corners
            - Ensures that when you start a new game, the corner squares
              are always free of mines.

Sound       - Click on this entry to toggle whether sound is on or not.
              You can also choose the sound level from the submenu.

High scores -> Show   - Opens the high score window
            -> Reset  - Clears the high score table of all the current high
                        scores.  Useful if you have received a copy of this
                        game from someone else and you want to clear their
                        scores out of the table.
                        But be careful, selecting this will probably result
                        in you losing your hard fought for high scores
                        forever.


Setting up a Custom level
-------------------------

You can set up a custom level by going into the 'Level->Custom->' dialogue
box.

You can set the width and height and number of mines by clicking on the
arrows.  The maximum size of the game area is 64 by 64, but Mine Hunt will
not let you go any bigger than the current screen mode will allow.

If you click on the 'Auto mines' button, Mine Hunt will choose a suitable
number of mines for you.  The number of mines Mine Hunt chooses for you
depends on the size of the game area you have set.

Once you are happy, click on the OK button.



+---------------------+
| Working from floppy |
+---------------------+

If you are playing Mine Hunt from a floppy, then it is worth noting the
following.

Mine Hunt will normally save the high score table each time someone achieves
a high score and enters their name.

This is so that Mine Hunt can keep an up-to-the-minute copy of the high
score table.  This works fine if you are running Mine Hunt from a hard disk
or keep the floppy you are running it from in the drive.

If however, you have removed the floppy when Mine Hunt goes to save the high
score table then you will be prompted to enter the disk.  If you choose to
do so, then thats fine.

If, however, you choose 'Cancel' when prompted to enter the disk, then Mine
Hunt will forget about saving the high scores from then on.  But if you quit
the game, you will be prompted once again and you will have the chance to
save the high scores then.  If you don't do it then, you will lose all the
highscores you had achieved during that session.
